Burns (1835 – September 9, 1864) was a Union Navy sailor in the American Civil War and a recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor , for his actions at the Battle of Mobile Bay . ## Biography Born in 1835 in Hudson, New York , Burns was still living in that state when he joined the Navy. He served during the Civil War as a seaman on the USS Lackawanna . At the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, Lackawanna engaged the CSS Tennessee at close range and Burns was severely wounded in the arm and back by flying debris. After receiving medical attention, he returned to his post and helped supply gunpowder to Lackawanna's artillery pieces for the remainder of the battle. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor four months later, on December 31, 1864. Burns's official Medal of Honor citation reads: On board the U.S.S. Lackawanna during successful attacks against Fort Morgan , rebel gunboats and the ram Tennessee in Mobile Bay, on 5 August 1864. Although severely wounded and sent below under the surgeon's charge, Burns promptly returned to his station and assisted the powder division throughout the prolonged action which resulted in the capture of the rebel ram Tennessee and in the damaging and destruction of Fort Morgan.",

Rayback (1914–1983) was a professor of history in the United States . ## Career He served in the United States Navy and earned a Ph.D. in American history at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. For many years, he was a professor of history and chair of the department at Pennsylvania State University . He was faculty advisor to Phi Alpha Theta , the honorary in history and with Donald B. Hoffmann helped to organize the society on a national basis. He served on the editorial board of the journal, The Historian , published by Phi Alpha Theta. Following service at Penn State, Rayback taught American history at the University of Saskatchewan in western Canada. In 1966, he was appointed professor of history at Temple University . Among the courses he taught at the undergraduate level at Temple were American social and political history. At the graduate level he held seminars in Slavery and Antislavery and the Antebellum period. Rayback studied the issues of American politics from 1830 to 1860 including federal politics of the slavery issue, and the rise of the Republican Party . He mentored dissertations in antebellum history, including the Antimasonic movement in New York State. As a corollary to this work, Rayback also became a scholar of early immigration policy in the U.S. In 1959, Rayback wrote a history of the American labor movement . Rayback was working on a biography of president Martin van Buren when he died in 1983. He had collected an immense amount of data on New York state elections in the period 1820-1860.

    "title": "Hob (video game)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hob_%28video_game%29",
    "content": "Hob is an action-adventure game developed and published by Runic Games . It was originally released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on September 26, 2017. An enhanced port developed by Panic Button was released in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch . It is the last game developed by Runic Games before their dissolution. It is set in a science-fiction world filled with bizarre wildlife, over-grown architecture, and arcane machinery. ## Gameplay Hob 's gameplay centers around two main components: exploration and combat. ### Exploration When the game starts, the player is only able to access a small area. As the game progresses, the player solves puzzles and unlocks powers that open up more areas of the map. ### Combat The core of Hob 's simple combat system is made up of four main actions: quick sword attack, slow punch attack, slower charge attack, and roll. Throughout the game the player can unlock more advanced combat maneuvers, such as a ground-slam attack and a deployable shield. Many of these maneuvers use up energy, which recharges at a slow rate. The player can also find items throughout the world that increase their default damage, maximum health, and maximum energy. ## Plot The story line of Hob is expressed through environmental storytelling, with more and more clues being revealed as the game goes on. Since there is no dialogue or written language, these clues are given through the environments, enemies, and other creatures that the player interacts with. The story of the world can be worked out from the 5 'lore rooms' present in the game, as well as the game's own prequel comic on the Runic Games website. The lore rooms in sequence show, in symbolic animated glyph forms: 1. A sun dying around a planet and a spaceship holding 4 elders and 20 disciples. 2. The spaceship departs that solar system before the sun dies and lands on a new world with an active sun. 3. Using the sun's power, the spaceship builds the raised platforms and the high tower present in the game. 4. Then, a new spaceship shows up and transmits a virus or infection to one of the elders in the high tower, who then spreads it to the rest of the platform structures (the infection is represented by the 'spikes' shown in the symbols). This is accompanied by a sound, 'woahlah', which the queen at the end of the game also makes. The appearance of the spikes is accompanied by chittering, creeping sounds. 5. Lastly, as a result of the infection spreading, the robots awaken. This lore-room contains one of the four elders, dead, suggesting that it was them that made the glyphs. The prequel comic then shows a robot awakening, to be transported to the surface of one of the platforms, where it sees many robots fighting the infection and being killed. It pops a blade out of its wrist, but is then stabbed by one of the infection plants. It retreats from combat and one of the 'sprites' in the game then heals it, causing greenery to grow from its wound. It then seeks out and opens one of the disciple chambers, releasing a character of the same species as the main character. This particular disciple has a pair of horn-like stubs on the top of its head. Unfortunately it is attacked and infected by a plant, develops blight-like growths on one side of its face, and is encased in a rainbow crystalline formation before it can do anything more. As the crystalline structure starts to break apart, the robot leaves and opens more disciple chambers. Many chambers are opened and it is assumed they have all failed to stop the infection. The last chamber it opens is the main character's, Hob. Throughout the course of the actual game, Hob will find many deceased disciples, who they obtain sword components from. They will also come across some of the rainbow crystal formations, which are always accompanied by a butterfly, suggesting that the crystals are chrysalises from which the butterflies have emerged. And they will be helped at points by the infected disciple shown in the prequel, who has become half-infection, half-disciple, with fungi-like horns emerging from where their head stubs were, a ragged coat and only one half of their face still unaffected by the infection. At the end of the game, Hob finds enough power cores to awaken one of the larger robots, which creates a bridge to reach the High Tower. Hob climbs the high tower, where they find the remaining three elders and the infected disciple. Two of the three elders are alive and uninfected, but incapacitated by the infection's plants, while the third is infected and enclosed by it. Hob stumbles upon a spore pod when realizing the elders are alive, and starts becoming infected. The infected 'queen' awakens, and uses her power to draw the infection from Hob. She gestures to herself and makes the sound 'woahlah', indicating a name. She then explains through gestures that the infection is not her, that it came from above and into her, and through her, to the planet. But she shows the beauty that it is capable of creating by showing the butterflies which the chrysalises have developed. She then offers Hob the choice of either joining her and the infection in co-existing on the planet, or siding with the other elders and destroying the infection. If Hob chooses the Queen, the world becomes covered with the rainbow crystalline structures, suggesting that more of it is being converted into symbiosis. The robot is shown post-credits opening yet another disciple chamber to try and stop the infection. If Hob chooses the Elders, it fights the infected disciple. When Hob kills the disciple the Queen accepts her fate and offers herself to be destroyed. Hob then takes her place on the throne as an elder. This destroys the infection across the planet, and the world is shown clean, with the disciples emerging from their chambers and being reunited. Post-credits the robot is shown finally going to sleep, accompanied by the sprites. ## Development and release Hob was developed by Runic Games . The game was announced in August 2015 at PAX Prime . Matt Uelmen composed the soundtrack for the game. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2017. This would be the final title to be developed by Runic Games, as the company closed following the release of the title. An enhanced version titled Hob: The Definitive Edition , developed by Panic Button , was released by Perfect World Entertainment for the Nintendo Switch on April 17, 2019. After the publisher's sale to Embracer Group , the game is currently published by Gearbox Publishing . ## Reception and reviews ReceptionHob received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic . As of April 2020, Hob has a \"very favorable\" rating on Steam , with 89% of user reviews being positive. Game Informer previewed it positively, stating, \"From the archaic machines dotting the landscape, to the bizarre creatures and even the mysteries surrounding the main character, Hob's narrative strength lies in showing rather than telling...I walked away from this demo impressed\". PC Gamer gave it a score of 77/100, saying in their verdict, it was \"a gorgeous world eager to be explored with satisfying puzzles and fun, if occasionally clumsy, action\". IGN said overall the game is a \"beautiful Zelda-like puzzler with fun combat elements that takes place on an enchanting world where nature and machinery alter the landscape as easily as a twist of a Rubik's cube. The wordless approach to the story creates some confusion and the fix camera sometimes results in unnecessary deaths, but never does the time spent with Hob feel wasted\". * Official website",

    "title": "Greek destroyer Vasilefs Georgios",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_destroyer_Vasilefs_Georgios",
    "content": "Vasilefs Georgios ( Greek : ΒΠ Βασιλεύς Γεώργιος ) ( King George ) was the lead ship of her class of two destroyers built for the Royal Hellenic Navy before the Second World War . Flagship of the navy's Destroyer Flotilla , she participated in the Greco-Italian War in 1940–1941, escorting convoys and unsuccessfully attacking Italian shipping in the Adriatic Sea . While under repair during the Axis invasion of Greece in 1941, Vasilefs Georgios sank when the floating drydock that she was in was either scuttled or sunk by German aircraft. The ship was later salvaged and repaired by the Germans who commissioned her into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in 1942 as ZG3 , later renaming her as Hermes . They generally used the ship to escort convoys to and from North Africa and islands in the Aegean Sea . In addition, the Germans occasionally used the ship to lay mines and to ferry troops and supplies. After Hermes was transferred to the Central Mediterranean, she sank a British submarine about a week before she was crippled by Allied aircraft in late April 1943. The ship was towed to Tunisia and was scuttled as a blockship shortly before the Allies occupied Tunisia in early May. They refloated the wreck and it was scrapped after the war. ## Design and description The Vasilefs Georgios -class ships were derived from the British G-class destroyers, modified with German guns and fire-control systems . They had an overall length of 98.4 meters (322 ft 10 in), a beam of 10.05 meters (33 ft 0 in), and a draft of 2.51 meters (8 ft 3 in). They displaced 1,371 metric tons (1,349 long tons) at standard load and 1,879 metric tons (1,849 long tons) at deep load . The two Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft , were designed to produce 34,000 shaft horsepower (25,000 kW ) using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots (67 km/h ; 41 mph ). During her sea trials on 30 October 1938, Vasilefs Georgios reached a speed of 36.6 knots (67.8 km/h; 42.1 mph) from 35,109 shp (26,181 kW), although her armament was not yet installed. The ships carried a maximum of 399 metric tons (393 long tons) of fuel oil which gave a range of 3,760 nautical miles (6,960 km; 4,330 mi) at 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph). Their crew consisted of 162 officers and crewmen. Unlike her sister ship Vasilissa Olga , Vasilefs Georgios was fitted out to accommodate an admiral and his staff. The ships carried four 12.7-centimeter (5.0 in) SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields , one pair each superfiring forward and aft of the superstructure . Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of four 3.7-centimeter (1.5 in) guns in four single mounts amidships and two quadruple mounts for Vickers 0.5 in (12.7 mm) AA machineguns . The Vasilefs Georgios class carried eight above-water 53.3-centimeter (21 in) torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts. They had two depth charge launchers and a single rack for their 17 depth charges. ## Construction and service ### In Greek service The Vasilefs Georgios -class ships were ordered on 29 January 1937 as part of a naval rearmament plan that was intended to include one light cruiser and at least four destroyers, one pair of which were to be built in Britain and the other pair in Greece. Vasilefs Georgios was laid down at Yarrow & Company 's shipyard in Scotstoun , Scotland , in February 1937, launched on 3 March 1938, and commissioned on 15 February 1939 after she had her armament installed in Greece. Pending the completion of the light cruiser, the ship served as the flagship of the Destroyer Flotilla, under Commander ( Antiploiarchos ) Pyrros Lappas . After the Delfino sank the elderly protected cruiser Elli in a sneak attack on 15 August 1940 off the island of Tinos , Vasilefs Georgios and her sister were sent to Tinos to escort the merchant ships there home. During the Greco-Italian War she escorted convoys and participated in raids against Italian lines of communication in the Strait of Otranto on the nights of 14/15 November 1940 and 4/5 January 1941 that failed to locate any ships. The sisters ferried the Greek gold reserves to Crete on 1 March. After the German invasion of Greece on 6 April, the sisters began to escort convoys between Greece and Egypt via Crete. While anchored in Sofiko Bay in the Saronic Gulf on 12–13 April, Vasilefs Georgios was attacked by German aircraft and badly damaged by near-misses that caused extensive flooding. She managed to reach the Salamis Naval Base despite a severe list where she was drydocked . On 20 April, the floating drydock was scuttled by the Greeks and sank with the unrepaired destroyer still inside it. ### In German service The Germans nonetheless were able to raise and repair her, and commissioned her into the Kriegsmarine as ZG3 on 21 March 1942, under the command of Commander ( Fregattenkapitän ), later Captain ( Kapitän zur See ), Rolf Johannesson . German alterations were not numerous: they reduced her 37 mm guns to a single pair and exchanged her anti-aircraft machineguns for five 2-centimetre (0.8 in) AA guns in single mounts. Two torpedo tubes were possibly removed as well. The ship also received German mine rails, radios and a S-Gerät sonar . Her crew now consisted of 10 officers and 215 sailors. After working up , ZG3 was declared operational on 30 May, although her first convoy escort mission, scheduled for 1 June, was cancelled. On 24–25 June, she helped to escort a small troop convoy to Souda Bay , Crete, returning to Piraeus , Greece, two days later. On 2–3 July, the ship helped to lay a minefield off the island of Syros . During the rest of the month, ZG3 escorted two convoys between Greece or Crete and North Africa and received a brief overhaul in the middle of the month. The ship escorted the damaged German submarine U-97 back to Salamis on 5 August. Her next convoy to Tobruk , Libya , was interrupted by the British Operation Pedestal to Malta in the middle of the month and she then towed the damaged submarine U-83 to Salamis on 19–20 August. ZG3 was then renamed Hermes two days later. Over the next several months, the ship escorted convoys between Greece, Crete and Tobruk, interrupted by occasional missions to cover a minefield being laid. Later that month her boilers were cleaned and her 37 mm guns were upgraded. Upon her return to duty on 23 October, she resumed escort work, only adding the Dardanelles and various islands in the Aegean and Dodecanese to her destinations. On 16 November Hermes assisted in the sinking of the Greek submarine Triton . Her propulsion machinery was overhauled at Salamis from 20 January 1943 to 19 February and she resumed her convoy escort missions until the end of March. During this time, none of the ships that she escorted were lost. With Axis forces confined to northern Tunisia by March, the Kriegsmarine ordered Hermes to transfer to Southern Italy on 30 March to protect the supply lines to Tunisia. Now under the command of Fregattenkapitän Curt Rechel , she arrived at Salerno , Italy, on 4 April. The ship laid a minefield south of Sicily with a group of Italian destroyers on 19–20 April. The following day, she detected the British submarine Splendid and drove it to the surface after 45 minutes of depth-charging, rescuing 20 survivors before the submarine sank. Together with two Italian destroyers, Hermes ferried troops and supplies to Tunisia on 25–26 April. Three days later, she made another supply run with two Italian destroyers, but they were attacked by Allied aircraft off Cape Bon . The two accompanying Italian destroyers were sunk and Hermes had her propulsion machinery crippled by near misses. She was towed to La Goulette , the port of Tunis , and scuttled at the harbor entrance as a blockship on 7 May. Several crewmen were killed in the fighting in Tunis the next day, while the others were either captured by the Allies or evacuated to Trapani , Sicily. Rechel had left for Sicily on the 7th, allegedly to report on the loss of his ship. The Allies refloated the wreck to clear the harbor and it was scrapped after the war. * Freivogel, Zvonimir (2003). \"Vasilefs Georgios and Vasilissa Olga: From Sister-Ships to Adversaries\".

    "title": "Quercus michauxii",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_michauxii",
    "content": "Quercus michauxii , the swamp chestnut oak , is a species of oak in the white oak section Quercus section Quercus in the beech family. It is native to bottomlands and wetlands in the southeastern and midwestern United States , in coastal states from New Jersey to Texas , inland primarily in the Mississippi – Ohio Valley as far as Oklahoma , Missouri , Illinois , and Indiana . ## Description The leaves of the swamp chestnut oak are simple (not compound), 4–11 inches (10–28 centimetres) long and 2–7 in (5–18 cm) broad, with 15–20 lobe-like, rounded simple teeth on each side, similar to those of chestnut oak and chinkapin oak ( Quercus muehlenbergii ), although they generally do not achieve the more slender form that the leaves of those trees may exhibit at times. The leaves turn red in autumn. The fruit is an acorn 2.5–3.5 cm (1– 1 1 ⁄ 2 in) long and 2–2.5 cm ( 3 ⁄ 4 –1 in) broad, borne on a 2–3 cm peduncle, maturing in the fall, about 6 months after pollination. The tree only bears heavy acorn crops at intervals of several years. ## Taxonomy The swamp chestnut oak closely resembles the chestnut oak ( Quercus montana ), and for that reason has sometimes been treated as a variety of that species. However, the swamp chestnut oak is a larger tree which differs in preferred habitat, and the bark does not have the distinctive deep, rugged ridging of the chestnut oak, being thinner, scaly, and paler gray. It typically grows to around 65 ft (20 m) tall, though the tallest specimen currently known is over 150 ft (42 m) tall. The name Q. prinus was long used by many botanists and foresters for the swamp chestnut oak, even when treated as a species distinct from the chestnut oak, which was then called Q. montana , but the application of the name Q. prinus to the chestnut oak is now often accepted, although sometimes that name is declared to be of uncertain position, unassignable to either species, with the chestnut oak then called Q. montana , as in the Flora of North America . ## Ecology The acorns of the swamp chestnut oak are eaten by generalist species like chipmunks, squirrels, white-tail deer, wild hogs, and black bears. They are also readily eaten by cattle , and the species is sometimes called the \"cow oak\" for this reason. ## Uses The wood of the swamp chestnut oak is similar to, and usually marketed mixed with, that of other white oaks. Swamp chestnut oak is also called basket oak, since the wood is easily split into long, thin, flexible strips excellent for basket weaving. The swamp chestnut oak's acorns are large, relatively sweet, and edible. The swamp chestnut oak is sometimes cultivated as a large garden tree or street tree, and is quite easy to grow if it is not subject to extreme urban conditions. The current National Champion Swamp Chestnut Oak is in the Stumpy Lake area in Virginia Beach, Virginia . It is 123 ft (37 m) high, with a crown of 109 ft (33 m) and a circumference of 23 ft (7 m).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996%E2%80%931997_Serbian_protests",
    "content": "In the winter of 1996–1997, university students and Serbian opposition parties organized a series of peaceful protests in the Republic of Serbia (then part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) in response to electoral fraud attempted by the Socialist Party of Serbia of President Slobodan Milošević after the 1996 local elections . During the course of the rallies, students held their protests separately from the citizens' ones, led by opposition then gathered in coalition Zajedno (Together). The students' protest lasted until 22 March 1997, with additional requests of replacing the management of University of Belgrade and return of the university autonomy. The protests started on 17 November 1996 in Niš where thousands of opposition supporters gathered to protest against election fraud. Belgrade University students joined on 19 November 1996 and protests lasted even after 11 February 1997, when Milošević signed the \" lex specialis \", which accepted the opposition victory and instated local government in several cities, but without acknowledging any wrongdoing. The protests were strongest in the capital Belgrade , where they gathered up to 200,000 people, but spread over most cities and towns in Serbia. ## Counter-protests On 24 December 1996 the government coalition called \"Za Srbiju\" (\"For Serbia\") organized a large counter-protest in Terazije . Milošević spoke to the crowd in Terazije, telling them \"Serbia will not be controlled by someone else's hand\". The crowd chanted \"Slobo, we love you\", to which Milošević replied, \"I love you too\". The 24 December protests in Terazije resulted in massive riots, during which a young protester from the SPO named Predrag Starčević was beaten to death. Another SPO protester, Ivica Lazović, was shot in the head the same night by a SPS supporter Živko Sandić. Although Lazović survived, he ended up with an arm and a leg paralyzed after a life-saving operation in the emergency room. Lazović eventually met Sandić in court, where he asked him, \"brother, why did you shoot me?\" Sandić allegedly replied, \"I don't know\", and Lazović forgave him in person, saying \"if my sacrifice was needed to prevent civil war in Serbia, then so be it.\" After the 24 December violence the government banned all street protests in Belgrade from 26 December 1996. Nebojša Čović , the mayor of Belgrade and an SPS member, claimed to have criticized the government's idea of counter-protesting, but that a majority of the SPS party board supported it. Milošević allegedly ordered police to stay disengaged from the counter-protest. Čović suggested to other SPS members that the counter-protest was risky, and defied Milošević's orders by calling in riot police. Čović was subsequently kicked out of the SPS in January 1997. He stood by his decision years later, claiming that civil war could have begun if it were not for the intervention of riot police that night. ## Protest on Branko's Bridge On the night of 2–3 February 1997 a confrontation occurred between riot police and protesters on Branko's Bridge , during which the police fired water cannons at the protesters, even though the outside temperature was −6 °C (21 °F). Vesna Pešić, leader of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, was hit by the police on the same night. According to Naša Borba , 29 protesters ended up in the Urgent Care emergency room, while the \"Anlave\" clinic received 50 patients that night. After the incident, Yugoslav Left spokesman Aleksandar Vulin said: \"They complain that the police used water cannons on the protesters at -10°C. Well, they're not going to pour hot water on them, are they?\" ## Kolarčeva street protest and the Serbian Orthodox Church In January 1997, a large column of riot police blocked off Kolarčeva street in Belgrade for several weeks, in spite of the continuation of a standoff with the student protesters. However, on 27 January 1997 the riot police opened Kolarčeva street, after which Patriarch Pavle and other members of the Serbian Orthodox clergy led a silent crowd of approximately 300,000 to the Church of Saint Sava . Contrary to what was reported at the time, the riot police left Kolarčeva street several hours before, as they anticipated the Patriarch and the crowd he would take to the Church of Saint Sava. ## Alleged role of the internet In early 1997, Wired journalist David Bennahum met philosophy professor Novica Milić at a conference in Berlin called the \"Data Conflicts: Cyberspace and the Geo-Politics of Eastern Europe\", after which Milić invited him to apply for a visa to visit Yugoslavia during the protests. Bennahum applied, eventually entered Yugoslavia and wrote about his experience and the alleged role of the internet in the protest mobilization in an article called \"The Internet Revolution\" . Bennahum wrote about the existence of an internet stream called Sezam Pro , which broadcast the independent radio station B92 after it had been censored by the Yugoslav government on 3 December 1996. Voice of America and BBC recorded these internet streams and broadcast them back to Belgrade through short-wave frequencies, whose signals were picked up by the radio. At the time of the protests, at least 8 million people were living in Yugoslavia, of which no more than 10,000 had access to the internet. Speaking to Nedeljnik , Milan Božić, a math professor who met with Bennahum to discuss internet access in Yugoslavia, claimed that Bennahum endangered him and Milić by publishing their names in his article, adding that there had been an agreement to keep their identities hidden from the authorities. Milić also commented for Nedeljnik , stating that Bennahum \"severely exaggerated\" the role of the internet in the 1996–1997 protests. ## Reactions Richard Holbrooke commented on the issue in his memoirs, recalling that the Americans were not able to support the protests due to the transitional period to the Clinton II Administration : \"A remarkable challenge to Milošević unfolded in the street of Belgrade in December [1996], led by three politicians who banded together in a movement called Zajedno, or the Together Movement. For weeks, hundreds of thousands of Belgrade citizens braved subfreezing weather to call for democracy. But Washington missed a chance to affect events; except for one ineffectual trip to Washington, Zajedno had no contact with senior American government officials, and the Administrations sent no senior officials to Belgrade for fear that their visits would be used by Milošević to show support. For the first time in eighteen months, Milošević felt no significant American pressure, and turned back towards the extreme nationalists, including Karadžić , for support. His tactical skills saved him again, and within weeks, the Together Movement was together no more, as its leaders split among themselves.\" * Anti-bureaucratic revolution * March 1991 protests in Belgrade * Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević * ^1 The Socialist Party of Serbia is abbreviated as SPS. * ^2 The Serbian Renewal Movement is abbreviated as SPO, the acronym for the movement's name in Serbian, Srpski pokret obnove. * Chris Hedges (8 December 1996). \"Serbian Response to Tyranny: Take the Movement to the Web\".

    "content": "Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War is a 1999 book by journalist Mark Bowden . It documents efforts by the Unified Task Force to capture Somali faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid in 1993, and the resulting battle in Mogadishu between United States forces and Aidid's militia. One of the key events is the downing of two United States MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, from which the book derives its title, and the attempt to rescue their crews. United States forces included 3rd Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment ; 160th SOAR ; Delta Force ; 24th Special Tactics Squadron ; DEVGRU Navy SEALs ; 10th Mountain Division ; as well as Malaysian and Pakistani United Nations peacekeeping forces. The raid became the most intense close combat in U.S. military history since the Vietnam War . Although the overall mission to apprehend Aidid was officially codenamed Operation Gothic Serpent , the media colloquially termed the incident the Battle of Mogadishu as well as the Battle of the Black Sea. ## History Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War is based on a series of 29 articles written by journalist Mark Bowden for The Philadelphia Inquirer . He did extensive research in US Army records, interviewed participants from both sides of the conflict, reviewed footage recorded by observation aircraft, and listened to recordings of radio traffic. Before the book was published, Bowden's series had already begun to attract attention within the media. It consisted of a CD-ROM, an hour-long video, and an audiovisual series on The Inquirer's Web site. Delta Force member Paul R. Howe provided much of the information about the Delta force operations for the writing of the book. Bowden met with Howe in 1997 after clearing it with Howe's commanding officer. Other Delta Force members also consulted for the book, but did not allow the use of their real names. Howe has faced some criticism for allowing Bowden to use his real name. In January 1991, militias overthrew the regime of President Siad Barre which led to the Somali Civil War . The United Nations later arranged a US-led intervention , with a mandate to engage in state building and encourage the militias to share power and begin to form a new government. President George H. W. Bush sent United States Marines into Somalia in December 1992 as part of a UN effort to secure transportation routes to deliver relief and food supplies , which had been disrupted by local militias. Uninterested in sharing power, Mohamed Farrah Aidid began to regard the ongoing UN mission as hostile and ambushed a peacekeeping convoy in June 1993, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. The UN mission's commander, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe , declared Aidid an outlaw, and the faction leader's forces and supporters subsequently began targeting the officer. The hunt for Aidid included a disputed attack on a house of clan officials and resulted in civilian casualties as well as increasing civilian hostility against the UN efforts, especially their use of helicopters. As a result, President Clinton approved Operation Gothic Serpent , a JSOC mission to apprehend Aidid. The operation created Task Force Ranger which was composed of Rangers, Delta Force, 24th Special Tactics Squadron airmen, DEVGRU Navy SEALs, and 160th SOAR aviators. One of the operation's missions led to several Black Hawk helicopters being shot down and an extended bloody battle between task force and UN forces against Somali militia. After the battle, the hunt for Aidid was called off. The U.S. subsequently pulled out, with the UN following suit a few months later. In 1996, Aidid died from wounds sustained during a battle against a rival militia. A new interim central administration, the Transitional National Government , was eventually formed in 2000, a year after Bowden's book was published. ## Critical reception Bowden's narrative was generally praised, particularly his efforts at contextualizing the local and international politics and explaining how the peacekeeping mission devolved into armed conflict, later termed the \" Mogadishu Line \". A New York Times piece found he conveyed the battle as a gripping narrative, giving a minute-by-minute account of the United States campaign in Mogadishu, known as the Battle of the Black Sea. It added that Bowden rapidly shifts viewpoints after US ground forces enter the city, trying to extract a couple of Aidid leaders and then, when things go wrong, rescue US forces. Additionally, the piece remarked how Bowden simultaneously manages to capture the siege mentality felt by both civilians and the US soldiers, as well as the broad sentiment among many residents that the Rangers were to blame for the majority of the battle casualties. The book was a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award for Nonfiction . ## Adaptations * The story first ran on November 16, 1997, as a 29-part newspaper series that was then adapted to an online multimedia package, a first for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bowden had amassed a large number of notes, audiotapes, documents, photos, and radio transcripts, and worked with the digital team at the Inquirer to post it online. At the time it served as one of the more innovative examples of multimedia storytelling by a news organization. The published online package contained videos, audio clips, graphics, maps, and links to external resources. * The book was accompanied by a video, Somalia: Good Intentions, Deadly Results, produced by KVR Video, that was aired on CNN on 24 March 1999 in a 57-minute version, as Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War; it later won an Emmy. * The book was adapted into a 2001 film, directed by Ridley Scott and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. * Battle of Mogadishu (1993) * In the Company of Heroes * Black Hawk Down (film) * Surviving Black Hawk Down ## Works cited * Bowden, Mark (1999).

She was the illegitimate daughter of Augustus II the Strong , ruler of Saxony and Poland–Lithuania , and his mistress, the Turk Fatima or Fatime , later renamed Maria Aurora von Spiegel . ## Life Katharina was the second child of the liaison between Augustus II and Fatima; her older brother, Frederick Augustus , was born four years before. Shortly after the birth of Frederick Augustus, the King married Maria Anna to his chamberman Johann Georg (von) Spiegel, but she remained as his mistress. Katharina was born during this marriage and legally used the name Maria Anna Katharina von Spiegel during her first years of life. In 1715, her stepfather Johann Georg of Spiegel died; her mother Fatima survived him by only five years. Augustus II took the guardianship of his children, but only recognized and legitimized both in 1724 and they were granted the title of Count and Countess Rutowska . The now Countess Rutowska was married off by her father on 1 October 1724 to the Polish nobleman Count Michał Bieliński . The marriage was an immediate failure and after eight unhappy years, in early 1732, they divorced. In 1737, she re-married, this time, a Sabaudian aristocrat in Saxon service, Count Claude Marie de Bellegarde et d'Entremont (1700–1755). From this marriage she has two children: one son, Mauritz de Bellegarde (1743–1792), general-lieutenant in service of Saxe, and one daughter, Frédérique Augusta Marie de Bellegarde , named after her maternal grandparents, who married François Sébastien de Chevron-Villette , called the Comte de Villette , on 27 April 1779. Their marriage was childless.",

    "content": "Microecology means microbial ecology or ecology of a microhabitat. It is a large field that includes many topics such as: evolution, biodiversity, exobiology, ecology, bioremediation , recycling, and food microbiology. It can also refer to a hybrid urban network at the scale of the neighbourhood. It is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment, and how these interactions affect the organisms and their environment. Additionally, it is a multidisciplinary area of study, combining elements of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and urban planning . It focuses on the study of the interactions between microorganisms and the environment they inhabit, their effects on the environment, and their effects on other organisms. Microecology also studies the effects of human activity on the environment and how this affects the growth and development of microorganisms or organic structures. Microecology has many applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and design. It is also important for understanding the cycling of nutrients in the environment, and the behavior of microorganisms or actors in various environments. In humans , gut microecology is the study of the microbial ecology of the human gut which includes gut microbiota composition, its metabolic activity, and the interactions between the microbiota, the host, and the environment. Research in human gut microecology is important because the microbiome can have profound effects on human health. The microbiome is known to influence the immune system, digestion, and metabolism, and is thought to play a role in a variety of diseases, including diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Studying the microbiome can help us better understand these diseases and develop treatments. Moving onwards, Intestinal microecology is a new area of microecology study. It is a complex microflora that is directly related to human health. Therefore, regulation of intestinal microecology will help in the treatment of many diseases. It was reported that intestinal flora is involved in anti-tumor immunotherapy and affects the curative effect of an anti-malignant tumor therapy to varying degrees. The activity of metabolites and microbial composition of the intestinal microbiota are associated with various diseases including gastrointestinal diseases and cancer . Similar to the intestinal microecosystem, the vaginal microecosystem is also complicated and plays an important role in women's health. Maintaining microecological balance and the acidic environment of the vagina inhibits the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria . ## Microecology in the Urban Context At the urban scale, the term micro-ecology has been used by Mueller-Wolfertshofer and Boucsein to describe the interdependence and interrelation of various activities within a neighbourhood. The synergy formed through socioeconomic processes, often with collaboration, profits all the actors involved and improves conditions, not just in the immediate neighbourhood, but at times even the city they are part of.",

    "content": "The Kolb Studio is a historic structure situated on the edge of the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in Grand Canyon Village within Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. It was operated from 1904 until 1976 as the photographic studio of brothers Ellsworth and Emery Kolb. ## History In 1902, Emery C. Kolb (1881–1976) and Ellsworth L. Kolb (1876–1960) first arrived at the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1911, they successfully navigated the Colorado River , filming their journey. Built between from 1904 and 1926, the building they constructed was both a family home and photographic studio for the pioneering Kolb brothers. The building has evolved through two major additions and countless minor changes during its century of existence at Grand Canyon. After the death of Emery Kolb in 1976, the National Park Service acquired the historic studio. During the 1990s, the Grand Canyon Association renovated the building and converted it to its current state. The Grand Canyon Association now operates an art gallery, bookstore and information inside the building. The bookstore's proceeds go to support the building, and the store features a tribute to the Kolbs’ photographs of mule riders at Grand Canyon. The start of the Bright Angel Trail is to the west of the Kolb Studio. ### Restoration project During 2013 and 2014, the Grand Canyon Association was in the process of restoring and rehabilitating this significant building. Work includes addressing the structural degradation of Kolb Studio. a) rectifying drainage problems from public sidewalks and corresponding retaining walls, b) stabilizing the concrete entranceway to assure safe continuing access to the facility c) repairing and replacing exterior building features (e.g. log and shingle siding, structural beams, gutters, wooden porches) in order to assure long-term structural integrity of the building and d) protecting restored exterior surfaces with paints, sealants and other coatings. * Buildings and structures in Grand Canyon National Park * National Register of Historic Places listings in Grand Canyon National Park * Rustic architecture in Arizona Wikimedia Commons has media related to Kolb Studio. * William C Suran (1991) The Kolb Brothers of Grand Canyon (Gem Guides Book Company) ISBN9780938216384 ## Related reading * Ellsworth Leonardson Kolb (2003) The brave ones : the journals and letters of the 1911–1912 expedition down the Green and Colorado Rivers by Ellsworth L.

    "content": "Henri Adolphe Schaep or Hendrik Adolf Schaep (3 January 1826, in Mechelen – 6 June 1870, in Antwerp ) was a Belgian painter, draughtsman and military officer. He is best known for his marines but also painted landscapes. Schaep was an important representative of the Romantic - Realist movement in Belgian marine painting. ## Life Henri Adolphe Schaep was born in Mechelen as the son of Franciscus, a baker, and Maria-Theresia Wauters. The family moved to Antwerp in 1828. Henri Adolphe commenced his artistic studies at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts in 1838. His studies overlapped with those of Egide Linnig , another future marine painter who had commenced his studies at the academy in 1834. Schaep did not only study art but simultaneously developed a career as a military officer. This career path brought him to various locations: he was a lieutenant in Ghent in 1840, he was based in Antwerp from 1846 to 1849, in 1849 he was in Ostend, in 1855 he was a captain in Mechelen, in 1857 he was based in Liege, in 1861 he was back in Antwerp and in 1862 in Brussels. From the 1840s onwards, Schaep started participating in the triennial salons of Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent and the provincial capitals of Belgium. His contribution to the Antwerp Salon of 1840 of the marine painting Palisade at the launch of a ship in Antwerp was likely his first participation in a salon. He also presented compositions called Marine to the Brussels Salon in 1848 and the Antwerp Salon in 1849. Schaep was active as a part-time painter. He was also recognised as a geologist and paleontologist. Schaep died in Antwerp on 6 June 1870. ## Work Henri Adolphe Schaep was mainly a painter of marines although he also painted landscapes. The Scheldt in Antwerp up to its estuary was one of his main sources of inspiration although he painted some scenes of the Thames. He is reported to have painted some kermesse scenes. He also collaborated with the Dutch landscape painter Nicolaas Johannes Roosenboom . Schaep was an important representative of the Romantic - Realist movement in Belgian marine painting. This movement saw its heyday between 1830 and 1860. Its representatives included Egide Linnig, Henri Lehon , François Musin and Paul Jean Clays . Schaep is a typical representative of this movement in the choice of his subject matter, which covers the usual romantic scenes such as storms, high seas and shipwrecks. He often painted the 'extreme moments' of the day: sunrise and sunset, the start and end of the day, when the color contrasts are the most intense and the colors are striking. A good example of Schaep's Romantic approach can be seen in A shipwreck (1857, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp ). The composition is perhaps one of the most impressive paintings in his oeuvre as it displays his high level of technical skill in the rendering of the stormy sea. The whole canvas is filled with the rough sea, the sky, the shipwrecked ship and the lifeboat without any other compositional props. * Media related to Henri Adolphe Schaep at Wikimedia Commons",

    "title": "Elsa Morante",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Morante",
    "content": "Elsa Morante ( pronounced [ˈelsa moˈrante, ˈɛl-] ; 18 August 1912 – 25 November 1985) was an Italian novelist, poet, translator and children's books author. Her novel La storia ( History ) is included in the Bokklubben World Library List of 100 Best Books of All Time. ## Life and career Elsa Morante was born in Rome in 1912, the daughter of Irma (née Poggibonsi), a schoolteacher, and Augusto Morante. Her mother came from a Jewish family in Modena . When she was a teenager Morante discovered that Francesco Lo Monaco, a family neighbour, was her biological father. Except for a brief period during World War II , she resided in Rome until her death in 1985. Morante started writing at an early age. Without having much support from her parents, she relied mostly on self-education. She began writing short stories in the mid-1930s. Some were published in various publications and journals, including periodicals for children. Her first book, a collection of short stories called Il Gioco Segreto (The Secret Game), was published in 1941. In the same year, she married fellow novelist and film critic Alberto Moravia . In 1942 she wrote her first children's book , Le Bellissime avventure di Caterì dalla Trecciolina (republished in 1959 as Le straordinarie avventure di Caterina ). During the German occupation of Italy late in World War II , Morante and Moravia, fearful because of their Jewish heritage, fled Rome to repair in Southern Lazio, in a village near Fondi and where there were several poor families of shepherds, called in the past, with an offensive term, \"ciociari\" in the modern Roman dialect. The experience would inspire Morante's La storia (1974) and Moravia's La Ciociara (translated in English in 1957 as \" Two Women \" and later made into a film by Vittorio De Sica ). During her time in the territory of Fondi , she began translating the work of Katherine Mansfield . Morante decided to briefly return to war-torn Rome at great personal risk to retrieve the manuscript of what would be her first published Menzogna e sortilegio and get winter clothes. At the end of the war, Morante and Moravia met the American translator William Weaver , who helped them to break into the English-speaking market. Her first novel, 1948's Menzogna e sortilegio , won the Viareggio Prize , and was published in the United States in 1951 as House of Liars . Despite her international success, Morante found the English translation quite disappointing. Morante's next novel, L'isola di Arturo , was published in 1957 and won the Strega Prize . In 1961 Morante and Moravia separated, without divorcing, and Morante's writing became more sporadic. She destroyed much of the work written during that period, although she did publish a novel, The Andalusian Shawl (1963), and a poem, The Adventure . Her next work, Il mondo salvato dai ragazzini ( The World Saved by Children ), a mix of poetry and songs mostly addressed to her new lover, artist Bill Morrow, was published in 1968. In 1963 Pier Paolo Pasolini invited Morante to select the music for his film The Gospel According to St. Matthew . She also collaborated in casting the actors. In 1974 Morante published La storia , a book chronicling the events surrounding Rome during World War II. It became a national bestseller in Italy, partially due to Morante's insistence that publisher Einaudi would put it out in an economical paperback edition. Despite its commercial success, the book provoked furious and at times negative reactions from left-wing literary critics, who disliked its anti-ideological tone. After Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote a negative review of the book, Morante broke off their friendship. La storia was adapted into a Rai television series in 1986. Morante's final novel, Aracoeli (1982), has been perceived as a summary of all the motifs and trends present in her writing, such as the innocence of childhood and the importance of creating fantastic worlds to escape from dreary realities. The first English-language biography of Morante, A Woman of Rome , by Lily Tuck , was published in 2008. ## Major themes Morante cultivated a love for music, books and cats. Her favorite books included The Iliad , Don Quixote , and Hamlet . She was also interested in Freudian psychology, Plato and Simone Weil . Southern Italy is also used as the backdrop for much of her work. Most of Morante's greatest works are shaped by her choices and experiences in life and are reflected in her protagonists. One of the central themes in Morante's work is Narcissism. The majority of Morante's leading characters use autobiography as a way to seek self-therapy and hope. Narration becomes a leading tool. Her writing is essential for the formation of a positive consciousness about her personal memories. Another important aspect of Morante's work is the metaphor of love. According to her, love can be passion and obsession, and can lead to despair or destruction. This trajectory is connected to her love for a nine-year-old boy when she was only two and a half years old. According to her, her first love was a heaven, but then it transformed into a hell. The metaphor of love can easily be traced back to one of her most famous poems, \"Alibi.\" Love and Narcissism are themes well connected to each other. Most of Morante's characters seek love, not because they have true feelings for the person they fell in love with, but because they need to cover the feelings of emptiness from their childhood. It is through love and narcissism that Morante introduces other themes such as the role of motherhood and the meaning of childhood experiences. ### Novels and novellas * Diario 1938 (1938) (Diary, publ.

It is also the main gateway to other areas within the Murut heartland and the minority of Lundayeh . ## Economy ### Agriculture The fertile land in Tenom and its surrounding area has made it primarily an agricultural area. The main agriculture sources in the area are rubber while soy beans , maize , vegetables, cocoa and coffee became the second contributor to the Tenom economy. ### Coffee Tenom coffee is a popular type of kopi , a Malay term for coffee beverage made from beans grown in Tenom. Among the main and largest producer of Tenom coffee is the Yit Foh Tenom Coffee , Tong Fah Coffee Factory and Fatt Choi Tenom Coffee. Tenom coffee is made from Robusta variety . The coffee bean was processed using traditional firewood and drum rotation methods followed for almost 50 years without adding any artificial ingredients or colourings. #### History coffee Originally, coffee started to be planted in Sabah during the administration of British North Borneo , but only focused in the area of the east coast on the forest reserve near mangrove areas. However, due to an outbreak of disease, it was abandoned in 1910. Since then, coffee production was concentrated in the west coast area. Tenom received attention when the British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBCC) established coffee and other plantations in the area. To take the resources to major towns, a railway line from Melalap to Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu ) was built by the British in the late 1890s. To increase the coffee production, many labourers from China , mainly those of Hakka and Cantonese descent, were brought to Tenom by the British as local workforce. Today, Tenom is widely known as an agriculture site with large coffee production and has been dubbed as the \"Sabah's coffee capital\". Together with cocoa , rice field and fruit crops, coffee is the second largest contributor to the Tenom agriculture economy after rubber . Due to its large demand from other countries since 2010s, the government began to help to address the shortage of raw coffee supply in Tenom. ### Tourism Among the primary tourist attractions in the district are the Sabah Agricultural Park (Lagud Seberang Agriculture Research Station), the Tenom Orchid Centre and the Murut Cultural Centre. The town is also known in the tourism industry for whitewater rafting on the Padas River and the coffee factory. Tenom railway station is the final stop of the Sabah State Railway , which originates from Tanjung Aru. * Ipoh white coffee * List of coffee drinks Media related to Tenom at Wikimedia Commons",

    "content": "Rónald Gómez Gómez (born 24 January 1975) is a Costa Rican former football forward and manager. He is the current manager for Liga Nacional club Achuapa . An important player on the Costa Rica national football team during the 1990s and 2000s, Gómez is regarded as one of Costa Rica's best forwards, known for his rocket shots and top dribbling. Gómez is, along with Paulo Wanchope , the top scorer for Costa Rica in the FIFA World Cup with three goals. ## Club career ### Early years Born in Puntarenas as the 12th child of Francisca Gómez, he was raised in the village Pilas de Canjel in Guanacaste Province . Nicknamed La Bala (The Bullit), Gómez started his career at Carmelita and scored his first league goal on 20 September 1992 against Saprissa . He then scored 45 goals for Alajuelense before moving abroad. ### Years abroad He has played in 6 different countries: in Spain with Sporting Gijón and Hercules of Alicante , in Guatemala with Municipal , in Greece with OFI , in Kuwait with Al Qadsia , in Mexico with Irapuato and in Cyprus with APOEL where he won the Cypriot First Division . ### OFI In the summer of 1999, Greek OFI made the decision to sign Ronald Gómez from Guatemalan club Municipal , marking the Costa Rican striker's return to Europe after spells with Sporting de Gijón and Hércules CF . Despite some hesitation from the Cretan club due to the risks involved, the transfer was completed within a matter of hours, and Gómez quickly established himself as one of the most significant players to have graced Greek football during that era. Known as a classic \" number 9 \" of the 1990s, Gómez became a cult figure in Greece due to his exceptional goal-scoring ability. He made a lasting impact on OFI, scoring 48 goals in 105 appearances. His performance helped lead the team to the UEFA Cup in the 2000–01 season, thanks to an impressive tally of 19 goals that season. One of his most memorable moments came with a stunning goal against Proodeftiki , considered one of the finest in Greek football history. Gómez’s tenure at OFIcemented his legacy, and he remains a beloved figure among the club’s supporters. ### Saprissa With Saprissa, he has won 4 national championship ; and 1 CONCACAF Champions Cup , and was part of the team that played the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship Toyota Cup where Saprissa finished third behind São Paulo and Liverpool . He scored the winning goal in the final minutes of the game that Saprissa won in order to achieve the third place of the tournament against Al-Ittihad . His goal was considered among the best of the cup. ### Return from retirement In June 2009, Gómez came out of playing retirement for a final season at Santos after he was relegated to the second division as manager of Carmelita. After the season, he became manager of Santos. ## International career Gómez made his debut for Costa Rica in a February 1993 UNCAF Nations Cup qualification match against Nicaragua and earned a total of 93 caps, scoring 26 goals. He represented his country in 27 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and figured at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. He also played at the 1993 and 2001 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 1993 , 2000 and 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 1997 , 2001 , and 2004 Copa América . His final international was a March 2008 friendly match against Peru . ### International goals Scores and results list. Costa Rica's goal tally first. ## Managerial career He made his debut as manager of Carmelita in January 2009. In October 2010 he was dismissed by Santos de Guápiles and he later managed second division sides Deportivo Cartagena and Juventud Escazuceña . In September 2013, he took charge of Guatemalan side Halcones and in May 2014 he returned to Costa Rica to take charge at Limón . In August 2023, Ronald Gómez, a former OFI player, returned to Greece as the head coach of Apollon Smyrnis , a team that was preparing for the upcoming season in the Greek Football League (Gamma Ethniki) . His appointment marked the return of a familiar face to Greek football, having been one of the top strikers for OFI during his playing career between 1999 and 2003. Prior to joining Apollon Smyrnis, Gómez had managed Santa Lucia F.C. in Guatemala. However, his tenure with Apollon Smyrnis ended on 28 February 2024. After his departure from Apollon Smyrnis, Gómez took on the role of head coach at Deportivo Achuapa in Guatemala, where he began a new challenge, aiming to lead the team to the final phase of the Torneo Clausura 2024 . ## Personal life He is married to Gina Soto and they have two sons, Esteban and Daniel. ## Honours * Primera División de Costa Rica (3): * 1995-96, 2005–06, 2007–08 * Copa Interclubes UNCAF (1): * 1996 * CONCACAF Champions' Cup (1): * 2005 * Cypriot First Division (1): * 2006–07 * Rónald Gómez at National-Football-Teams.com * 2006 World Cup profile – Nación",

    "content": "Stephen Keith Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint (born 7 November 1948), is a British politician, former Conservative Minister of State for Trade and Investment, former group chairman of HSBC Holdings plc , and Anglican priest. ## Early life and education Stephen Green was born on 7 November 1948 to Dudley Keith Green and Dorothy Rosamund Mary Green (née Wickham). After a private education at Lancing College , near his family home in Brighton , he attended Exeter College, Oxford , obtaining a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) in 1966. Green's parents were active churchgoers and influenced his religious activities both as a young man and later in life; after graduating he spent a year volunteering in the East End of London at a hostel for recovering alcoholics, a move also reputedly influenced by a visit from a Church of England vicar. It was during his time at the hostel that he met Janian Joy, a fellow volunteer, whom he married in 1971. In 1975 (during a Harkness Fellowship , on secondment from the Overseas Development Administration) Green also obtained a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ## Career In 1971, Green began his professional life as a civil servant in the British government 's Ministry of Overseas Development (now the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office ), where he spent the next six years. In 1977, he joined McKinsey & Co Inc. management consultants, with whom he undertook assignments in Europe, North America and the Middle East. As a result of being headhunted , Green joined the then Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1982, initially on a two-year contract, with responsibility for corporate planning activities. In 1985 he was put in charge of the development of the bank's global treasury operations, and in 1992 became group treasurer of HSBC Holdings plc with responsibility for the HSBC Group's treasury and capital markets businesses globally. In March 1998 Green was appointed to the board of HSBC Holdings plc as executive director of Investment Banking and Markets, responsible for the investment banking, private banking and asset management activities of the Group. He assumed additional responsibility for the group's corporate banking business in May 2002. As executive director, Green cancelled all executive bonuses in both 2001 and 2002, telling The Wall Street Journal in March 2003: \"We took the view that a business that had not performed for the shareholder couldn't expect to receive bonuses\". The decision saw some key staff leave in protest but it also won the company some praise; Institutional Investor magazine quoted HSBC's then chairman, Sir John Bond , as saying: \"We had corporate clients come up to us and say, 'Thank God you've taken a stand'\". In the year before becoming chief executive, Green earned below £1m; HSBC's annual report for the period showed that none of the company's five top-earning employees was a board member. Green told The Guardian in October 2003: \"Plenty of people in this organisation earn more than me. I genuinely don't care. I can hardly be described as lowly paid. Since when was money the be-all and end-all?\" Asked by the newspaper's reporter Jill Treanor how he reconciled the organization's high salaries and bonuses with his religious faith, he replied: \"Do I personally feel some kind of incompatibility between what I believe and being in financial services markets? I can only say no\". His appointment as group chief executive took effect on 1 June 2003. Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC announced that it would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the \"gloves were off\". He defended the decision, telling The Guardian ' s Jill Treanor: \"If you are a responsible company like us we do need to think about this on a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. I also have to bear in mind that people are going to get jobs in India (and elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs.\" He added: \"Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we want to jeopardise the quality of customer service\". Green also oversaw HSBC's acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender , as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his appointment as its chief executive. In January 2005, Green became chairman of HSBC Bank plc , the group's UK clearing bank subsidiary, and group executive chairman in June 2006. In its July 2005 issue, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported that HSBC was allowing money laundering by drug dealers and state sponsors of terrorism ; the magazine alleged that this had included a transfer of $100,000 in April 2000 to the Taliban in Afghanistan which had subsequently resulted in a fine levied by the US Treasury Department . Green denied the allegations, calling them \"a singular and wholly irresponsible attack on the bank's international compliance procedures\". Subsequent investigations however, confirmed that money laundering had taken place at HSBC for several years throughout Green's tenure as chief executive and chairman, chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel . Green earned well over £25 million per year at the time. Green's successor as the top of HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, said \"between 2004 and 2010, our anti-money laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behaviour.\" ### Minister of State for Trade and Investment In September 2010, it was announced that Green would join the UK's Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government in early 2011 as an unpaid Minister of State for Trade and Investment . In order to take up his ministerial position, he stepped down as group chairman of HSBC on 3 December 2010 and was replaced by Douglas Flint . To enable him to be accountable to Parliament, he was created a life peer on 16 November 2010 as Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint , of Hurstpierpoint in the County of West Sussex, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 22 November. He was Minister of State for Trade and Investment in both the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 11 January 2011 until 11 December 2013. ### Aftermath After Green's retirement from HSBC, the questions that had begun to be asked about the bank's behaviour under his leadership continued. On 23 July 2012, the US Senate 's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 335-page report setting out HSBC's compliance failures over a ten-year period. In the report, Senate investigators said the bank had bypassed the USA's sanctions against Iran, enabled money laundering by Mexican drug lords (chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel ), and had conducted business with companies with links to terrorism. The report quoted emails copied to Green detailing such dubious transactions and alleged that the bank had continued to allow them to continue even after he and his colleagues had promised to act. Green told Sky News that he had \"no case to answer\" over the money laundering scandal, saying: \"As and when issues were drawn to our attention, as we were seeking to grapple with the issues, we took action. I think we must acknowledge there were some failures of implementation. HSBC has expressed its regret for that. I share that regret.\" Defending Green, Lord Oakeshott , a former Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said: \"Stephen Green was a thoughtful banker in holy orders. But if even he couldn't stop these scandals, banks like HSBC and Barclays aren't just too big to fail, they are clearly too big to control\". The Senate report prompted shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie , to write to Green asking him to \"place on the record – at the earliest opportunity – an assurance that you took every appropriate step if and when you became aware of the issues raised by this report\" and asking a number of specific questions. Leslie was unconvinced by Green's reply, in which he had written: \"With regards [ sic ] to the bank's efforts to address its AML (anti-money laundering) and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliance issues, HSBC has expressed its regret that there were failures of implementation in these areas, and I share that regret\". Leslie maintained that Green's letter failed to: address the detailed questions about what he knew and when about these very serious issues. As a British Minister, an adviser to George Osborne on banking and a member of the Cabinet committee on banking reform, he is accountable first and foremost to Parliament. He cannot and should not hide behind \"continuing discussions between HSBC and the US authorities\" as a reason for failing to answer questions. Shortly afterwards, Green failed to attend the House of Lords to answer a Labour question about the affair. The Leader of the House of Lords , Lord Strathclyde , defended Green, saying that his earlier employment with HSBC did not affect his ability to carry out his duties. In February 2015, there was further criticism of Green and his leadership of HSBC after BBC Television broadcast a Panorama programme entitled The Bank of Tax Cheats exposing the complicity of HSBC's Swiss private bank , HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA, in helping more than 100,000 clients from over 200 countries evade tax worth hundreds of millions of pounds. At the time of the alleged offences Green was the Swiss bank's chairman. BBC presenter Richard Bilton confronted Green, who refused to discuss the issue saying only: \"As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present\". Chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee , Margaret Hodge MP, said: \"Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer\". A few days after the Panorama broadcast, Green resigned as chairman of the advisory council for banking industry body, The City UK, saying that he did not want to damage the effectiveness of the organisation in promoting good governance and doing the right thing. ## Other Some of his prior directorships included the Bank of Bermuda Limited , HSBC Mexico, SA and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited. He was also chairman of HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA and HSBC North America Holdings Inc. , deputy chairman of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG and was a board member of HSBC France . In 2005 he was appointed a trustee of the British Museum , a position from which he resigned before his appointment as Minister of State. In 2014 he was appointed a trustee of the Natural History Museum by the Prime Minister David Cameron for a period of four years, and was elected chair by the board of trustees from 1 April 2014. ### Awards Green was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 where he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who's Who publication. ## Personal life Green is an ordained priest in the Church of England , having studied theology at Manchester University 's Northern Ordination course while in Hong Kong , and he is the author of the book Serving God? Serving Mammon? He has since described the book as \"out of print and out of date\". During his time as a senior banking executive, he was known to compose his sermons while travelling around the world on business. Green was awarded an honorary doctor's degree from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London in 2010. He is married to Janian and has two daughters, Suzannah and Ruth. He has a sister, Elizabeth, who lives in the US and a brother, George Francis Green, who is professor of Labour Economics and Skills Development at the Institute of Education , University of London. ## Publications * Green, Stephen (7 May 1996).

    "title": "Viktor Dyk",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Dyk",
    "content": "Viktor Dyk ( Czech pronunciation: [ˈvɪktor ˈdɪk] ; 31 December 1877 – 14 May 1931) was a nationalist Czech poet, prose writer, playwright, politician and political writer. He was sent to jail during the First World War for opposing the Austro-Hungarian empire . He was one of the signatories of the Manifesto of Czech writers . Dyk co-founded a political party and entered politics. He died at age 53, leaving his many poems, plays and writings. ## Life Dyk was born in Pšovka u Mělníka in the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1877. His family moved to Prague in 1888 where he began to write. His family settled in the Prague suburb of Vinohrady in 1904 and that year he published a novel titled The End of Hackenschmid which was anti-Austrian. Dyk had taken part in the Czech Chess Championship the year before and he was to remain interested in the game for at least the next twenty years. He was most active in 1913 and seven of his games between 1903 and 1927 are recorded but, of these, only one is a victory. Viktor Dyk studied at a gymnasium in Prague (one of his teachers was Alois Jirásek ). Dyk completed his education at Charles University in Prague where he achieved a law degree. Later, law and politics were to dominate his life. In 1911, he became involved in politics and joined the Czech Constitutionalist Progressive Party ( Státoprávně pokroková strana ). He stood for office in the 1911 elections, but received just 205 votes in Vinohrady and placed fourth overall of five candidates. Dyk together with Franz Kafka spoke of a \"Great Wall\" which, like the Great Wall of China or the Tower of Babel , became a metaphor for the cultural and linguistic division that they believed was required between Czech and Germanic culture. Dyk wrote in the magazine Lumír , where he was known to state that Bohemia had to become Czech or they should die in the attempt. On April 13, 1913, he composed a tirade in reply to an article published by Franz Werfel . Dyk stated that his group had not built the \"Great Wall\" as they were not opposed per se to German ideas, however they did see the dangers. Dyk saw no problem with communicating with Germans but he warned against \"surrender\" to ensure that they did not become \"Czech speaking Germans\". During the First World War , he continued to write and he became involved in helping write a libretto for an opera by Leoš Janáček . Janáček's fifth opera, The Excursions of Mr. Brouček to the Moon and to the 15th Century went through a number of librettists and Dyk worked on Janáček's opera which was based on a story by Svatopluk Čech . In 1915 he started working with Vinohrady Theatre . Later he was imprisoned in Vienna for his resistance activities against Austria-Hungary . He was in jail in 1916 and 1917 for suggesting that Moravia and Bohemia could secede from the empire. In May 1917 Dyk was one of the signatories of the Manifesto of Czech writers . This was an important document created by Jaroslav Kvapil who was the director of Czech National Theatre . Kvapil managed to get 200 writers to sign the manifesto and it was designed to encourage the Czech deputies to the Imperial Council in Vienna to support Czech self-determination. In 1918, he co-founded the Czechoslovak National Democratic Party ( Czech : Československá národní demokracie ). His writings were designed to inspire nationalism in the fight to reclaim the Kingdom of Bohemia from Austrian rule. In 1907 he became the editor of the magazine Lumír . He was to lead this magazine for the rest of his life. The magazine's followers were known by the same name as the magazine. The writers and artists involved started a new direction in Czech culture. Previously, the culture was seen as coming from Germans and sources in German. For instance, German poets like Heinrich Heine were translated poem by poem from German to Czech. With the emergence of the Lumír group writers like Vrchlický, Dyk himself and Julius Zeyer the focus turned away from German culture. This change of focus is said to have led other Czech intellectuals to also look in this new direction for scientific, economic and social ideas. His political views were conservative and nationalist and in 1920 he was elected to parliament. In the times of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia , Viktor Dyk was one of the prominent intellectual opponents of President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk . In 1928 he married the writer Zdenka Hásková . In the 1929 parliamentary election , Dyk became a senator of Czechoslovakia, representing the Czechoslovak Democratic Party. Viktor Dyk died of heart failure on 14 May 1931 while swimming in the sea near the island of Lopud , near Dubrovnik in Croatia. He was replaced as senator by Jan Kapras . Dyk's funeral attracted many mourners. He was buried at Olšany Cemetery in Prague. ## Legacy Dyk has a number of monuments including one in Vinohrady , where he lived most of his life. Jiří Jílek created a life-sized bronze bust on a granite plinth in his birthplace of Mělník in the Bohemian area of the Czech Republic. The statue is on the street Vilohrady Karla IV by the Štefánik observation point. The statue does not mention his career or life span but merely says \"Viktor Dyk\". There is also a monument to Dyk on the Island of Lopud created by Nikola Dobrović in 1936. The concrete monument is on hill where three paths meet and it was paid for by the former government of Czechoslovakia. Dyk's book Krysař (English: Rat-catcher ) was the basis for a 2003 film of the same name by director F.A. Brabec . The film was shot in under 24 hours, leading to producers of the film claiming it to be a world record for the fastest-ever film shooting. The same book was also used by Jiří Barta in creating the base story for his 1986 animation The Pied Piper . Barta notes that it is Dyk's book which is the basis of the average Czech's understanding of the Pied Piper story. Czech President Václav Klaus cited one of Dyk's poems in his 2011 New Year's address to the nation, urging Czech citizens not to emigrate. Klaus's speech was directed at the Czechs who were finding the fiscal restrictions of the economy difficult to bear. Klaus appealed to nationalists with Dyk's suggestion of what the nation would think: \"I will survive if you leave me – but without me you will surely die.\" ## Works ### Poetry * A porta inferi, 1897 * Síla života, 1898 * Marnosti, 1900 * Satiry a sarkasmy, 1905 * Milá sedmi loupežníků, 1906 * Pohádky z naší vesnice, 1910 * Giuseppe Moro, 1911 * Zápas Jiřího Macků, 1916 * Noci chiméry, 1917 * Devátá vlna 1930 * Lehké a těžké kroky 1915 * Anebo 1917 * Okno 1921 * Poslední rok 1922 ### Prose * Stud, 1900 * Hučí jez a jiné prózy, 1903 * Konec Hackenschmidův, (The End of Hackenschmid) 1904 * Prosinec, 1906 * Prsty Habakukovy, 1906 * Píseň o vrbě, 1908 * Příhody, 1911 * Krysař, 1915, English edition The Pied Piper, Karolinum Press 2018, ISBN978-80-246-3440-1. * Tajemná dobrodružství Alexeje Iványče Kozulinova, 1923 * Tichý dům, 1921 * Zlý vítr, 1922 * Prsty Habakukovy, 1925 * Můj přítel Čehona, 1925 * Dědivadelní hra, 1927 * Holoubek Kuzma, 1928 * Soykovy děti, 1929 ### Political literature * Ad usum pana presidenta republiky (1929 – criticism of Edvard Beneš and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk * O národní stát (posthumously 1932–1938, 7 books of Dyk's political writing from 1917 to 1931) ### Plays * Epizoda, 1906 * Posel, 1907 * Zmoudření Dona Quijota, 1913 * Veliký mág, 1914 * Zvěrstva, 1919 * Ondřej a drak, 1919 * Revoluční trilogie, 1921 * Napravený plukovník Švec, 1929 – support of Rudolf Medek ### Memoirs * Vzpomínky a komentáře, 1927 ### Opera libretto * Partially wrote libretto of The Excursions of Mr. Brouček to the Moon and to the 15th Century Wikimedia Commons has media related to Viktor Dyk.Wikisource has original works by or about: Viktor Dyk * List of Czech writers",

    "content": "Samrat Ashoka is a 1992 Indian Telugu -language historical drama film written, produced and directed by N. T. Rama Rao under his Ramakrishna Horticultural Cine Studios banner. The film stars Rama Rao in the title role, alongside Vani Viswanath , Mohan Babu , Gummadi , Satyanarayana , and Ranganath . The music was composed by M. S. Viswanathan . Despite its grandeur and historical subject, the film was a box office failure. ## Plot The film is based on the life of the 3rd Mauryan Indian emperor Ashoka . It begins in Ujjain, ruled by King Rayani Rachamallu, who unwillingly performs his daughter Tishya Raksha's nuptial. Just before, Emperor Ashoka abducted the bride. Rachamallu could not abide it for association with the enslaved class. So, he ploys to assassinate Ashoka via Tishya. On the verge, Tishya detects him as the same stranger she crushed and spins back. Once on his hunt, Emperor Bindusara spots & wedlocks Sage Kaushila's daughter Subhadrangi / Dharma and is blessed with Ashoka. However, she is hounded and classed as the underdog by her fellow wives. Plus, Ashoka's 100 siblings mock & torment him, which Dharma countenances and quits. Here, the aura of fear-defying scholar Chanakya guides her, stating Ashoka was born to succeed in his aim to unite the country under a reign. According to his mandate, Dharma raises Ashoka in a mystical cave, molding him as a gallant. Ashoka is powerless to resist the captivity and unbound like a roaring lion. Amid this, he secures Tishya from the tiger when they endear. Simultaneously, satrap Malavasimha Rudradeva binds Bindusara by the rebellion. At that point, Ashoka encounters and blames his father. Then, as remorseful, he discerns him as only one fit as Emperor and bestows him with the hierarchical sword Karthikeyam of Chandragupta Maurya . Ashoka beats Malavasimha in a duo war, who bows down and befits as his staunch. Tragically, Bindusara passes away when imperialism Ashoka becomes bloodthirsty and callously decapitates all his kins. Listening to it, Tishya wholeheartedly accepts him. Parallelly, an infuriated Rachamallu conspires with Raja Anantha Padmanabha, the Emperor of Kalinga , and fans the flames against Ashoka. Ergo, he imparts an ultimatum when an outraged Ashoka declares the war as a last step for his sovereignty. Besides, Chanakya's aura peacefully mingles in the universe. En route, Buddhist monks oppose Ashoka about his sanguinary, which he deaf ears and moves on by butchering them. Meanwhile, Rachamallu plots to backstab him, but Tishya shields her husband by self-sacrifice. The battle erupts, which ends victoriously with the massacre. The same night, Ashoka walks into the theatre of war and takes a bloodbath, losing his men, including Malavasimha. Here, he views a blind old lady, Kartruni, who is searching for her son's corpse. Since he is a stranger to her, she seeks a favor to kill Ashoka. Here, guilt-ridden Ashoka accords his sword to Kartruni, revealing his identity when she self-sacrifices it as a curse to him. At last, Ashoka throws the sword after soul-searching and enlightens by embracing Buddhism with a proclamation that Non-Violence is the Supreme Piety. Finally, the movie ends Ashoka's Wheel of Piety, flying colors on our National Flag. ## Cast * N. T.

    "content": "Dornoch ( foaled April 22, 2021) is a retired multiple-Grade one winning American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 2024 Belmont Stakes and Haskell Stakes . ## Background Dornoch is a bay colt bred in Kentucky by Grandview Equine. His sire Good Magic was the U.S. Champion Two-Year-Old in 2017 after he won the 2017 Breeders' Cup Juvenile as a maiden; in 2018 he finished second in the Kentucky Derby . Good Magic, in 2024 stands for $125,000 at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Paris, Kentucky. His dam, Puca, is a Grade 2-placed stakes-winning daughter of Big Brown . Breeders Grandview, with the help of Alex Solis II and Jason Litt, went to $475,000 for Puca at The November Sale in 2018, Fasig-Tipton Kentucky's boutique fall mixed sale where she was consigned by Denali Stud. Puca's offspring include 2023 Kentucky Derby winner Mage . Dornoch was bought by the Oracle Bloodstock agent as a yearling at the Keeneland September Sales for US$325,000.

    "title": "Amirbai Karnataki",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amirbai_Karnataki",
    "content": "Amirbai Karnataki ( c. 1906 – 3 March 1965) was a famous actress/singer and playback singer of the early Hindi cinema and was famous as Kannada Kokila . Mahatma Gandhi was an ardent fan of her song Vaishnav Jan To . ## Early life Amirbai Karnataki was born in Bilgi town, Bijapur district, Karnataka into a middle-class family. Of all of her five sisters, Amirbai and her elder sister, Gauharbai, earned fame and fortune. Amirbai completed her matriculation and went to Bombay at the age of 25 in 1931. ## Career Amirbai was a talented singer and actress, who was fluent in Kannada (mother tongue) and Gujarati languages. \"Mahre Te Gaamde Ek Vaar Aavjo\" is one of her famous Gujarati songs from the film Ranak Devi (1946) , with music composer Avinash Vyas. A representative from His Master's Voice was so impressed by her singing talent that he made her sing a Qawwali , which became very popular. This qawwali song was for the film Zeenat (1945) by film producer-director Shaukat Hussain Rizvi . She sung her most famous duet song with Lata Mangeshkar \"Gore Gore O Banke Chhore\" Film: Samadhi. Her elder sister, Gauherbai, was an actress and helped Amirbai get a role in the film Vishnu Bhakti in 1934. Initially, Amirbai sang songs in films, but they failed to attain the success she desired. In 1943, with the release of Bombay Talkies ' Kismet (1943 film) , she achieved popularity: the songs of Kismet became a rage and Amirbai became famous. The man behind the success was the composer Anil Biswas . She was initially known as a singing star, but at the decline of her career, she became a playback singer. She reached her career peak by 1947. After 1947, Lata Mangeshkar became a rising star, so once again Amirbai switched over to acting. In her later years, she mostly played character roles. Amirbai also composed music for Wahab Pictures' film Shehnaaz (1948). In the same year she almost left Hindi Cinema for Gujarati and Marwari films. One of the famous film magazines \"Film India\" had mentioned in one of its articles that at that time in the 20th century, when other singers used to get Rs. 500 for singing a song, Amirbai used to get Rs. 1000 per recording. ## Personal life Amirbai's married life was full of ups and downs. Her first marriage was to the film actor Himalyavala (aka Afzal Qureshi). He was well-known for playing villainous roles in the movies. He used to beat Amirbai frequently after their marriage, and spent most of her earnings for his personal leisure. Amirbai had to put a fake smile on her face while performing as an actress and even while singing in studios. Famous Gujarati writer Bhai Ranjan Kumar Pandaya has recounted Amirbai's married life in detail. He says that Amirbai's elder sister Ahilya Bai, yearning for justice, one late night went to the famous Gujarati lawyer Chelshankar Vyas. She told Vyas that Himalayavala took a handsome amount and Amirbai's car in return for a divorce. The very next day, he had even kidnapped her publicly from a recording studio. He had imprisoned her in a room and was repeatedly beating her. Even the police sided with Himalayavala. Chelshankar Vyas, taking into account all these allegations, decided to help her. He used his societal status and judicial understanding and finally got a divorce for Amirbai. In 1947, when India was partitioned into India and Pakistan , Himalayavala went to Pakistan and earned himself a good reputation as a talented actor. In India, Amirbai got married for the second time to Badri Kaanchwala, the editor of Paras , who was a better husband. ## Selected songs * \"O' Jaanay Waalay Balamwa Laut Kay Aa, Laut Kay Aa\" Sung by Amirbai Karnataki and Shyam Kumar, lyrics by D. N. Madhok and music by Naushad Ali in the film Rattan (1944) * \"Dheere Dheere Aa Re, Baadal\", from the film Kismet (1943 film). * \"Priya madhuvanadali\", a Kannada song, sung by Amirbai, which is popular all over Karnataka even today ## Death She had a paralytic attack in 1965, and died just four days later. She was buried in her hometown. A cinema hall is still run in the name of \"Amir Talkies\" in the city of Vijayapura (Bijapur), by her family. ## Biography * Amirbai Karnataki written in Kannada by Rahamat Tarikere * Amirbai Karnataki (translation by Prashant Kulkarni).

    "title": "List of baseball parks in San Francisco",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_baseball_parks_in_San_Francisco",
    "content": "Early history of baseball in San Francisco, California . ## Portsmouth Square It has been speculated that the game of baseball was played in California by men during the Gold Rush of 1849 when Alexander Cartwright , who is sometimes referred to as \"the father of baseball\", came to San Francisco and is reported to have brought his baseball to the city in 1849. The Daily Alta California newspaper reports a game of base ball being played upon the Plaza (Portsmouth Square) \"by a number of the sporting gentlemen about town\", on February 3, 1851. Mention of the play of a game of Townball at Portsmouth Square is recorded in The Daily Alta California newspaper on January 14, 1852. An early town leader serving on the city council as second alcalde , or assistant mayor, of San Francisco during the years 1849-1854 was Frank Turk a New York Knickerbocker . According to historian Frank Joel, baseball was formally introduced into California, at San Francisco in 1859. ## The beginning years, 1860s In the 1860s, baseball grew in prominence in San Francisco, with the first game reported to be between the Eagles and the Red Rovers on February 22, 1860. The San Francisco Directory in 1860 identifies three base ball clubs, the Eagle, Em Quad, and Excelsior Clubs. In 1867 it was reported that \"baseball clubs are now the rage\" and the game of baseball drew plaudits from influential quarters. That year marked the establishment of the first baseball league in San Francisco known as the Pacific Coast Base Ball Convention with play 14 clubs from San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Clara county. The San Francisco clubs were named the Eagles, Pacifics, Lafayettes, Knickerbockers, Atlantics, Bay City, Empires, Brodericks and the Cosmopolitans. The 1867 championship game, between the Atlantic and Cosmopolitan clubs, was won by the Cosmopolitans by a score 50 to 45 on April 27, 1867. In the 1870s additional teams were named the Libertys, Wide Awakes (Oakland), Alhambra, Americans, Excelciors and the San Franciscos. ## First baseball park, Recreation Grounds California's and San Francisco's first enclosed professional baseball park, located in the heavily Irish workingman Mission District , was named simply The Recreation Grounds and opened November 26, 1868 and operated until November 23, 1884. Built on the site of the Pioneer Race Course , a horse race track owned by George Treat, the facility was used for multiple purposes including base ball games and cricket matches as early as October 1860. The grandstand accommodated initially a capacity of 12,000 fans and was later expanded to hold 17,000. Home of the Pacific Baseball League beginning in 1878, the ballpark was owned and operated by the politically active Captain Al Fritz of the influential Workingman's Party of California in partnership with Samuel Shear on land leased from San Francisco Mayor Andrew J. Bryant . In later years, after the death of Fritz, the Recreation Grounds was leased by Waller Walace and Andy Pierce for organized ball play with the preeminent team of that era being the Haverlys . In 1879 league play included a new Military League, organized by newspaper reporter Joseph H. McCloskey , drawn from teams of local militias which were generally aligned along ethnic lines. The period of 1881 to 1886 saw league play from the California League which failed to achieve much organizational competence; during the year 1883, for instance, there were only 36 games among four teams. The ballpark was bounded by Harrison, Twenty-Fifth, Folsom and Twenty-Sixth Streets, including present day Garfield Square . Photo. Other teams playing in Recreation Grounds included the Eagles, Wide Awakes, Niantics, Woonsockets and Reddingtons. 37.7507306°N 122.4137028°W ## Amateur and practice fields 19th Century amateur and practice fields . During the 1870s and 1880s baseball was a very popular recreation in San Francisco with amateur games and practices held prior to professional games at the professional parks, and at fields located at 15th and Folsom, 25th and Howard in the Mission District, at 8th and Harrison South of Market and at Filmore and Geary in the Richmond. A sand lot baseball field was located at Pierce and Haight Streets, 1886 photo. ## Union Grounds **Union Base-ball Grounds or Union Grounds**: Opened in October 1879. Used for baseball and for other sports. First reference in city directories is 1880, last is 1882.

During a game on June 5, 1926, the stadium caught fire from a cigarette, and soon burned down. In the process, embers started fires across the streets and destroyed several homes. With the ballpark fire raging, the firemen concentrated their efforts on protecting the rest of the neighborhood, including the Presentation Convent behind the left field corner of the ballpark. From 1926 until 1938 the field remained unoccupied. In late October 1938, developers announced plans for constructing a new housing development to be named Ewing Terrace.

    "content": "Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllmusicAudiodog is the first solo album by former Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick , released October 23, 2001 by Perris Records. The album was produced by Bruce Kulick and Curt Cuomo, and features Kulick on bass, guitar and vocals, and Cuomo on keyboards and backing vocals. Brent Fitz , with whom Kulick had worked before in the band Union , plays drums on all but two songs, which feature longtime John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff . Kulick and Cuomo composed, engineered and mixed the album, and it was mastered by Don C. Tyler. Chuck Wright did graphic design and illustrations, with photography by Glen LaFerman. AllMusic 's Greg Prato gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars; he compares Audiodog to other solo albums released by previous and current members of Kiss around the same time, saying it \"is certainly one of the better ones.\" Prato's review is quoted in Encyclopedia of KISS: Music, Personnel, Events and Related Subjects , as he credits Kulick with: ...present[ing] an album that -- rather expectedly -- doesn't stray far from the renowned Kiss sound. Although his songwriting contributions while a member of Kiss were never as pronounced as those by founding members Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons , he has certainly absorbed their songwriting styles, as most of the tracks on Audio Dog would've sounded right at home on a late '80s or early '90s Kiss release. The name Audiodog derives from the home studio setting where the album was recorded, with Kulick's dog Joe close by throughout the process. In 2012, a limited edition version of the album was released to commemorate Joe's passing. The re-release included additional tracks \"495\" (an instrumental from the original EP ) and the acoustic, aptly named \"Bruce Sings To Joe\". ## Track listing All songs written by Curt Cuomo and Bruce Kulick except where noted. Brent Fitz played drums on all tracks except where noted.

    "title": "Pyramid of Khendjer",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Khendjer",
    "content": "The pyramid of Khendjer was a pyramid built for the burial of the 13th dynasty pharaoh Khendjer , who ruled Egypt c. 1760 BC during the Second Intermediate Period . The pyramid, which is part of larger complex comprising a mortuary temple, a chapel, two enclosure walls and a subsidiary pyramid, originally stood around 37 m (121 ft) high and is now completely ruined. The pyramidion was discovered during excavations under the direction of Gustave Jéquier in 1929, indicating that the pyramid was finished during Khendjer's lifetime. It is the only pyramid known to have been completed during the 13th Dynasty . ## Excavations The first investigations of the pyramid of Khendjer were undertaken in the mid 19th century by Karl Richard Lepsius , who included the pyramid in his list under the number XLIV. The pyramid was excavated by Gustave Jéquier from 1929 until 1931 with the excavation report published two years later in 1933. ## Pyramid complex In South Saqqara , the pyramid complex of Khendjer is located between the pyramid of Pepi II and the pyramid of Senusret III . The main pyramid currently lies in ruins, due in part to the damaging excavations by G. Jéquier and now rises only about one meter above the desert sand. ### Enclosure walls The pyramid complex comprises the main pyramid enclosed by two walls. The outer one, made of mudbrick, contained in the north-east corner a small subsidiary pyramid, the only one known dating to the 13th dynasty. The inner enclosure wall was made of limestone and patterned with niches and panels. This replaced an earlier mudbrick wavy-wall, which led Rainer Stadelmann to suggest that the wavy-wall was constructed as a provisional and abbreviated substitute to the more time consuming but preferred niched-wall. At the south-east corner of the outer wall is a blocked unfinished stairway, which could be part of earlier plans for the pyramid substructure or part of an unfinished south tomb, meant for the Ka of the deceased king. ### North chapel A small chapel was built immediately adjacent to the north side of the main pyramid, inside the inner enclosure wall. The chapel was raised on a platform and could be reached by two stairways. The north wall of the chapel housed a yellow quartzite false door . The location of this door was unusual as it should have stood on the wall closest to the pyramid, i.e. the south wall rather than the north one. The few surviving fragments of relief from the chapel show standard scenes with offering bearers. ### Mortuary temple On the eastern side of the pyramid lay a mortuary temple which spread across both enclosure walls. This allowed for the outer section of the temple to be placed outside the inner wall, with the inner sanctuary on the inside of the inner wall. Very little remains of the temple, except for pieces of reliefs and columns and parts of its pavement. ## Main pyramid The pyramid originally stood at 70 royal cubits in height, which is about 37 metres (121 ft). The pyramid was constructed with a mudbrick core and a limestone outer casing with its backing stones. These and the limestone casing were both quarried by stone robbers, which left the core unprotected. The core fared very badly with time and the pyramid now stands only one meter (3.3 feet) tall due to its disintegration. A fragmented black granite pyramidion was discovered on the east side of the complex and has been restored by G. Jéquier. It is now on display at the Egyptian Museum , Cairo. The pyramidion is decorated by reliefs showing Khendjer making offerings and is inscribed with the prenomen \"Userkare\" ( Strong is the ka of Ra ), which is thus known to be a throne name of Khendjer. The entrance to the substructures is located at the base of the southern end of the pyramid west side. A stairway with 13 steps leads to a chamber housing a large granite portcullis similar to those encountered in the Mazghuna pyramids, also dated from the Middle Kingdom . The portcullis was originally destined to block the way to the burial chamber but was never put into place across the passage. Beyond the portcullis chamber, a further stairway with 39 steps continued down to a closed double-leaf wooden door. Beyond the door is a second portcullis chamber, which was also left open. In turn this leads to a small antechamber and from there on to a further corridor whose access was concealed beneath the paving of the antechamber floor. This corridor leads to the burial chamber. Khendjer's second portcullis chamber, antechamber and corridor were constructed in the corner of a large trench dug in the ground. The burial chamber, which is made of a colossal monolithic quartzite block, was placed in the trench before the pyramid construction started, in a manner similar to the burial chamber of Amenemhet III at Hawara . The weight of the quartzite block was estimated at 150 tons by G. Jéquier. The block was carved into two compartments destined to receive the king's coffin, canopic chest and funerary goods. Two large quartzite beams weighing 60 tons formed its roof. Once the block and its roof had been put into position, the workers built a gabled roof of limestone beams and a brick vault above it to relieve the weight of the pyramid. The mechanism for closing the vault consisted of sand-filled shafts on which rested the props of the northern ceiling slab. This would be lowered on the vault on draining the sand. After draining all the sand, the workmen escaped through the corridor which they filled with masonry and paved over its opening in the antechamber. ## Subsidiary pyramid At the north eastern corner of Khendjer's pyramid complex is a small subsidiary pyramid, which is thought to have been prepared for the burials of two of Khendjer's queens. G. Jéquier also found shaft tombs nearby, which may have been prepared for other royal family members. The entrance to the substructures of this pyramid lie at the base of its eastern base. A small stairway leads to two portcullis chambers similar to those found in the main pyramid. Here too the portcullises were left open. Beyond is an antechamber branching to the north and south to two burial chambers lined with masonry and both housing a large quartzite coffer. The lids of the coffers were found propped on blocks as they should be before any burial. The two coffers were thus most probably never lowered into place and put into use. Some unexpected turn of events probably prevented their use, although there is nothing directly suggesting that the king wasn't interred as planned in the main pyramid. However, in his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period , egyptologist Kim Ryholt concludes that Khendjer's successor, Imyremeshaw , usurped the throne. * List of Egyptian pyramids * Egyptian pyramid construction techniques * The Pyramid Complex of Khendjer * \"Egypt Sites\".

This was the fifth regular season tie-breaker. The postseason began with Game 1 of the 59th World Series on October 4 and ended with Game 7 on October 16. In the seventh iteration of this World Series matchup, and their first since the Giants relocated to San Francisco from New York , the Yankees defeated the Giants, four games to three, capturing their 20th championship in franchise history, winning back-to-back World Series.

The format would be used until 1969 . Opening Day took place on April 9, featuring four teams. The final day of the scheduled regular season was on October 1, which saw all 20 teams play, the first time all existing teams played on the final day since 1960 . Due to the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants finishing with the same record of 101–61, a best-of-three tie-breaker was scheduled, to be considered an extension of the regular season, and took place between October 1 and October 3. The World Series took place between October 4 and October 16. ## Teams ## Standings ### American League ### National League * The San Francisco Giants defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in a best-of-three tie-breaker series to earn the National League pennant. ## Postseason The postseason began on October 4 and ended on October 16 with the New York Yankees defeating the San Francisco Giants in the 1962 World Series in seven games. ### Bracket ## Managerial changes ### Off-season ### In-season ## League leaders ### American League ### National League ## Awards and honors ### Regular season ### Other awards * Sport Magazine'sWorld Series Most Valuable Player Award: Ralph Terry (NYY) ### Monthly awards #### Player of the Month ### Baseball Hall of Fame * Bob Feller * Jackie Robinson * Edd Roush * Bill McKechnie (manager) ## Home field attendance ## Television coverage CBS and NBC continued to air weekend Game of the Week broadcasts.

    "title": "Lekythos",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekythos",
    "content": "A lekythos ( Ancient Greek : λήκυθος ; pl. : lekythoi ) is a type of ancient Greek vessel used for storing oil, especially olive oil . It has a narrow body and one handle attached to the neck of the vessel, and is thus a narrow type of jug , with no pouring lip; the oinochoe is more like a modern jug. In the \"shoulder\" and \"cylindrical\" types which became the most common, especially the latter, the sides of the body are usually vertical by the shoulder, and there is then a sharp change of direction as the neck curves in; the base and lip are normally prominent and flared. However, there are a number of varieties, and the word seems to have been used even more widely in ancient times than by modern archeologists. They are normally in pottery , but there are also carved stone examples. Lekythoi were especially associated with funerary rites, and with the white ground technique of vase painting, which was too fragile for most items in regular use. Because of their handle they were normally only decorated with one image, on the other side from the handle; they are often photographed with the handle hidden, to show the painted image. ## Function The lekythos was used for anointing the bodies of the dead, and many lekythoi are found in tombs. The images on lekythoi were often depictions of daily activities or rituals. Because they are so often used in funerary situations, they may also depict funerary rites, a scene of loss, or a sense of departure as a form of funerary art . These are usually outline drawings that are quite expressionless and somber. The decoration of these ceramic vessels consists of dull red and black paint. These colors may have been derived from the Bronze Age , but were not used until 530 BC in Athens. Many artists of these vessels attempted to add more color to the figures, but later abandoned the idea, which provides more of a contrast. These vessels were very popular during the 5th century BC, however, many have been found dating back to 700 BC. They contained a perfumed oil which was offered either to the dead person or to the gods of the underworld. Some lekythoi were fitted with a small, inner chamber, limiting the amount of oil required to fill them. The lekythos was used to smear perfumed oil on a woman's skin prior to getting married and were often placed in tombs of unmarried women to allow them to prepare for a wedding in the afterlife . ## Types Lekythoi can be divided into five types: * the standard or cylindrical lekythos, which measures between 30 and 50 cm (12 and 20 in), though there are much larger \"huge lekythoi\", up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in), which may have been used to replace funerary stele; * the Deianeria lekythos which originates from Corinth; this form, with an oval profile and a round shoulder and generally small in size (20 cm), was produced from the beginning of the black-figure period until the end of the 6th century; * the shoulder or secondary lekythos, a variation on the standard type produced from the mid 5th century on. These have a fuller, swelling body; most are decorated with the white ground technique and measure around 20 cm (8 in); * the squat lekythos, usually less than 20 cm in height, with a rounded belly and a flat base; * the acorn lekythos, a rarer form, which has an oval profile and at the bottom of the body a raised cup with protrusions, like the cup of an acorn. There are also \"plastic\" lekythoi, with bodies formed in the shape of a head, animal, or other form. * Ancient Greek vase painting * Corpus vasorum antiquorum * Lekythion – lit.'small lekythos', a metric pattern in poetry named after this type of vessel * Loutrophoros * Pottery of ancient Greece * Reed Painter Wikimedia Commons has media related to Lekythoi. * \"Beazley\", \"Lekythos\", Classical Art Research Centre, University of Oxford.

    "title": "Cobequid Educational Centre",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobequid_Educational_Centre",
    "content": "Cobequid Educational Centre ( CEC ) is a high school located in Truro, Nova Scotia , Canada. CEC serves not only the town of Truro, but rural areas in Central and West Colchester County . The school is one of the largest high schools in the province of Nova Scotia, with approximately 1500 students and 90 teaching staff. ## History CEC opened in September 1970 as an experiment in amalgamating rural high schools in Nova Scotia. As well as serving as a replacement for the former Truro Senior High School, (which was also known by an earlier name, the Colchester Academy), CEC also replaced the former Central Colchester High School and West Colchester High School, which became junior high schools (grades five to nine for the newly renamed West Colchester Junior High School and grades six to nine for the newly renamed Central Colchester Junior High School). When CEC opened, it was operated by the Colchester-East Hants Amalgamated School Board. As a result of the amalgamation of school boards in Nova Scotia, CEC is now operated by the Chignecto-Central Regional Centre for Education . ## Academics CEC offers students the option to participate in an academic program referred to the International Baccalaureate program; this makes CEC an IB World School. The International Baccalaureate is a worldwide educational foundation with more than 4700 IB World Schools. The specific program offered at CEC is the IB Diploma Programme , which students take in grades 11 and 12. Upon starting high school, students are given the option to take courses in grade 10 that are referred to as Pre-IB courses. These classes are available to students who are considering taking the IB Diploma Programme. The Pre-IB classes are not associated with the IB program, but are designed by the school to help students ease their way into the IB program or help them make their decision to participate in the program or not. Students also have the option to take some IB classes, while not fully enrolling in the IB program. By doing so these students will receive an IB Certificate instead of a Diploma upon graduating. To receive an IB Diploma, students must complete a six core subject curriculum, which includes language and literature, language acquisition, individuals and societies, sciences, mathematics, and the arts. They must also write an essay of up to 4000 words, known as the Extended Essay, complete externally assessed exams, two formal projects, and a minimum of 50 hours of community service (AKA CAS hours, which stands for Creative, Activity, Service ). In some instances, depending on the university, IB courses can be used as a transfer credit or a fulfillment of university degree requirements. This can benefit some high school graduates when they attend university or college, but it can be inferred that merely taking the IB Diploma Programme or IB courses can set up a student for success in university. Students are also able to take numerous French immersion courses, and by meeting specific required credits hours they can obtain a French Immersion Certificate. This grants that the student is officially bilingual. Many subjects are also offered as Integrated French classes. Upon completing certain required credits, much like the French immersion program, a student would be awarded an Integrated French Certificate at the end of their grade 12 year. This certificate indicates that the student is officially 'partially bilingual'. Standard Core French classes are also offered to students for grades 9, 10, 11, and 12. ## Sports and athletics Since the founding year, CEC has had numerous sports teams. All of the competitive sports include football , soccer , volleyball , basketball , hockey , curling , bowling , weight lifting , cross country , track and field , golf , wrestling , skiing , snowboarding , rugby , badminton , softball , baseball , and table tennis . CEC participates in the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation (NSSAF) and has won many banner titles over the years. The athletic motto is 'a tradition of excellence' and athletics at CEC are a large part of many students high school experience because of the vast amount of sport opportunities and competitive tradition. In 2018, the boys volleyball team started their season with a three straight tournament winning streak. In the third tournament, the annual Dalhousie University high school tournament, the cougars went undefeated in the round-robin with straight-set wins over Citadel Phoenix (25–14, 25–5) and Horton Griffins (25–11, 25–16). In the quarterfinal, the boys won over the Dartmouth Spartans (25–16, 25–14) and in the semifinal won over Auburn Drive Eagles (25–11, 25–16). To win it all, the cougars defeated Par-en-Bas in the final 25-22 (set 1), 25-23 (set 2). CEC has also shown success in track and field, with the team winning seven championship banners at the NSSAF track and field championships at Beazley Field in Dartmouth in 2017. The cougars set a new NSSAF individual record and three new school records, by winning the overall Division I title, Intermediate Girls and Boys, and Senior Girls and Boys divisions. This marks the second time a Nova Scotia school has done so, the first being 25 years ago (also accomplished by CEC). The CEC track and field team were champions in the following categories: * Intermediate Girls Provincial Champions with 107 points * Intermediate Boys Provincial Champions with 135 points * Intermediate Banner (Combined Boys and Girls) with 242 points * Senior Girls Provincial Champions with 134.5 points * Senior Boys Provincial Champions with 171 points * Senior Banner (Combined Boys and Girls) with 305.5 points * Div. I Banner with 547.5 points There were also provincial records set by some of the Cobequid athletes. Michael Adams broke the CEC and provincial record in Intermediate Boys javelin; he threw 51.86 metres. The Intermediate Boys 4x100 metre relay team, members Kamryn Matheson, Cameron Degroot, Brody Schmidt and Zach Richards, set a new CEC record for the event by finishing in 45.98 seconds. Kamryn Matheson set another new CEC record, he ran the 200 metre event in 23.1 seconds to achieve the Intermediate Boys 200 metres CEC title. In basketball, CEC has hosted their annual Snowball Tournament since the school year of 1970–1971 to present. ## Clubs and activities Past and present clubs offered at CEC include yearbook committee, reach of the top, debate club, French club, student council, symphonic band, jazz band, pit band, gaming club, art club, shared reading, chess club, 5K run club, tennis club, prom committee, kick boxing, math league, programming club, interact club, drama club, international club, cougar cafe, and choir. ## Dedication On February 28, 2023, CEC students petitioned to and subsequently renamed the auditorium in honour of Portia White , Truro-born singer for African Heritage Month. ## Notable faculty and alumni * Jamie Baillie, businessman and politician * Terry Baker, CFL kicker * Cory Bowles, actor * Jeff Douglas, actor * Page Fletcher, actor * Brett Lauther, CFL kicker * Leo McKay, Jr., author * Justin Palardy, CFL kicker * Kathryn Smith, author * Lenore Zann, actress and politician * Cobequid Educational Centre",

    "content": "Douglas James Harris (born 20 December 1962) is a former Australian cricketer . From Perth , Harris excelled at junior levels, and represented the Australian national under-19 cricket team in a three- Test series during the 1980–81 season. He was named Man of the Series after scoring 195 runs from five innings. From the early 1980s, Harris was regularly selected in state colts and second XI matches, though Tim Zoehrer was generally the first-choice wicket-keeper at state level. In a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia during the 1985–86 season, Western Australia's wicket-keeper Michael Cox was unavailable to keep wicket in South Australia's second innings. Despite not having been named twelfth man, Harris substituted for Cox as wicket-keeper, and recorded two stumpings off the bowling of Wayne Andrews . However, these dismissals are not included in his career records. Harris continued to occasionally play in colts and second XI matches throughout the late 1980s. His sole match at first-class level came during the 1990–91 season, in a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland . In the match, held at the Gabba in February 1991, Harris played as a specialist batsman, opening the batting with Mark Lavender in both innings. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, but scored 23 runs in the second innings as part of a 61-run opening stand with Lavender (113*). At grade cricket level, Harris played for both Southern Districts (later Willetton) and Subiaco-Floreat . After retiring, he has filled several positions with the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) at various stages, including manager and coach of the state under-19 team, coach of the state second XI, state selector, state high-performance manager, and state talent manager. As state coaching manager, he was also involved in launching the Dennis Lillee Fast Bowling Academy in 2002.",

During her tenure, she spearheaded several transformative reforms aimed at improving the quality, inclusivity, and accessibility of education across the country. One of her significant achievements was the introduction of the Inclusive Education Policy in 2015. This landmark policy aimed to ensure that children with special needs could access quality education alongside their peers, promoting equal opportunities and inclusivity in Ghana’s education system. A key focus area during her tenure was empowering girls and advocating for gender equity in education. Her leadership drove the implementation of policies that tackled gender disparities, promoted higher female enrolment and retention rates, and empowered girls through education. Her initiatives played a pivotal role in creating more inclusive opportunities for young women across Ghana. Additionally, she led the conversion of 10 polytechnics across the regions into technical universities, a bold initiative that elevated the status of these institutions, broadening their academic scope and enhancing vocational education. This reform was instrumental in aligning Ghana’s educational framework with global trends, equipping students with practical skills for a competitive job market. During her tenure, Opoku-Agyemang initiated the construction of 124 Community Day Senior High Schools, known as \"E-Blocks,\" to improve access to secondary education in underserved areas. By the end of her term, 50 schools were completed and operational, providing modern facilities such as science laboratories, libraries, and ICT centres. This initiative significantly expanded educational opportunities, particularly in rural and peri-urban communities, and underscored her commitment to addressing disparities in access to quality education. Opoku-Agyemang oversaw the completion of key infrastructure at the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) in Ho, including the School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, a hostel block, and staff accommodation at its Sokode campus. The university was inaugurated by President John Dramani Mahama in November 2015, underscoring the government's commitment to expanding access to quality higher education and supporting the training of health professionals to address national healthcare needs. She also played a critical role in establishing the University of Environment and Sustainable Development (UESD) in the Eastern Region. She facilitated the passage of the enabling Bill in Parliament and secured funding for the university. In December 2016, President John Mahama officially cut the sod for the construction of the UESD’s Somanya campus. ### Vice presidential campaign Opoku-Agyemang was selected as the presidential running mate for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) on 6 July 2020 for Ghana’s December 2020 General elections. She became the first female running mate of the two major political parties in Ghana. Her selection by the flagbearer, John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress was applauded by women groups and women activists as a positive sign to the Ghanaian political scene to promote gender balance and equality. She appealed to Ghanaians to vote for change and promised to use her office as vice president to influence sustainable development and practical youth-centred policies. Her campaign message was devoid of attacks on opponents. Her intensive campaign in the coastal communities and her home region, the Central Region yielded results as the NDC won most of the constituencies they had lost in 2016. The NDC also won 9 out of the 16 regions in Ghana including the major battleground, Greater Accra . The NDC National Executive Committee, on 7 March 2024, officially endorsed Opoku-Agyemang again as the running mate for the party's flagbearer, ahead of the 2024 general elections.

Each year, a preliminary competition is held in each college and then representatives from each school compete on the final evening of the main competition. The singing contest is usually held before the end of the school year. No one school has monopolized the competition, which is not the case in some of the other college competitions. ## The list of Winners starting from the first competition * 1990 – Fjölbrautaskóli Suðurlands * Performer: Lárus Ingi Magnússon * Song: Eltu mig uppi (Sálin hans Jóns míns) * 2nd place: Móeiður Júníusdóttir, MR * 3rd place: Páll Óskar Hjálmtýsson, MH * 1991 – Flensborgarskólinn í Hafnarfirði * Performer: Margrét Eir Hjartardóttir * Song: Glugginn * 2nd place: Hera Björk Þórhallsdóttir, FB * 3rd place: Ottó Tynes, MS * 1992 – Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík * Performer: Margrét Sigurðardóttir * Song: Látúnsbarkinn (Stuðmenn) * 1993 – Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík * Performer: Þóranna Jónbjörnsdóttir * Song: Dimmar rósir * 1994 – Menntaskólinn í Kópavogi * Performer: Emilíana Torrini * Song: I Will Survive * 2nd place: Flensborgardætur Berglind Helga Sigurþórsdóttir, Katrín Ósk Einarsdóttir, Sigrún Pálmadóttir * 3rd place: * 1995 – Fjölbrautaskóli Norðurlands vestra * Performer: Hrafnhildur Ýr Víglundsdóttir * Song: Wind Beneath My Wings * 2nd place: Sara Guðmundsdóttir, Flensborg * 3rd place: Svavar Knútur Kristinsson, MH * 1996 – Menntaskólinn í Kópavogi * Performer: Þórey Heiðdal Vilhjálmsdóttir * Song: Hetja/ Hero (Mariah Carey) * 2nd place: Regína Ósk, MH * 3rd place:Jón Jósep Snæbjörnsson, MA * 1997 – Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð (Hamrahlid College) * Performer: Haukur Halldórsson and Flóki Guðmundsson (Limó duet) * Lag: Harmleikur/Tragedy (Bee Gees) * 2nd place: MK * 3rd place: Harpa Heiðarssdóttir MA * 1998 – Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð (Hamrahlid College) * Performers: Aðalsteinn Bergdal, Davíð Olgeirsson, Kristbjörn Helgason, Orri Páll Jóhannsson and Viktor Már Bjarnason (Brooklyn fæv) * Song: Óralanga leið/For the Longest Time (Billy Joel) * 2nd place: * 3rd place: * 1999 – Flensborgarskólinn í Hafnarfirði * Performer: Guðrún Árný Karlsdóttir * Song: To Love You More (Celine Dion) * 2nd place: Þorvaldur Þorvaldsson, Menntaskólinn við Sund * 3rd place: Arnbjörg Ösp Matthíasdóttir, Lára Bryndís Eggertsdóttir, Lovísa Árnadóttir and Sigríður Rafnar Pétursdóttir (Djúsí-systur), Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík * 2000 – Fjölbrautaskóli Norðurlands vestra * Performer: Sverrir Bergmann * Song: Always (Bon Jovi) * 2nd place: Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, Flensborg * 3rd place: Helgi Valur Ásgeirsson, Fjölbrautarskóla Suðurlands * 2001 – Flensborgarskólinn í Hafnarfirði * Performer: Arnar Þór Viðarsson * Song: Þakklæti/To be Grateful (Trúbrot) * 2nd place: * 3rd place: * 2002 – Fjölbrautaskóli Norðurlands vestra * Performer: Eva Karlotta Einarsdóttir & the Sheep River Hooks * Song: (Original Song – title needed) * 2nd place: Eva Dögg Sveinsdóttir Kvennaskólinn í Reykjavík * 3rd place: * 2003 – Menntaskólinn á Akureyri (Akureyri Junior College) * Performer: Anna Katrín Guðbrandsdóttir * Song: Vísur Vatnsenda-Rósu * Arrangement: Ólafur Haukur Árnason and Styrmir Hauksson * 2nd place: Sigþór Árnason, Fjölbrautaskóli Suðurlands * 3rd place: Elísabet Eyþórsdóttir, Borgarholtsskóli * Venue: Íþróttahöllin á Akureyri * 2004 – Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð * Performers: Sunna Ingólfsdóttir and Sigurlaug Gísladóttir * Song: Green Eyes (Erykah Badu) * 2nd place: Heimir Bjarni Ingimarsson, Verkmenntaskólinn á Akureyri * 3rd place: Birgir Olgeirsson, Menntaskólinn á Ísafirði * 2005 – Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík * Performer: Hrund Ósk Árnadóttir * Song: Sagan af Gunnu * 2nd place: Dagný Elísa Halldórsdóttir, Verkmenntaskólinn á Akureyri * 3rd place: Elísabet Ásta Bjarkadóttir, Fjölbrautaskóli Suðurlands * 2006 – Fjölbrautaskóli Vesturlands * Performer: Helga Ingibjörg Guðjónsdóttir * Song: Ruby Tuesday (Rolling Stones) * 2nd place: Menntaskólinn í Kópavogi * 3rd place: * Sms kosning: Hann og Hún – Brynjar Páll Rögnvaldsson – Helgi Sæmundur Guðmundsson – Hrund Jóhannsdóttir – Ragnheiður Silja Have Jónsdóttir * 2007 – Verkmenntaskólinn á Akureyri * Performer: Eyþór Ingi Gunnlaugsson * Song: Framtíð bíður * 2008 – Verzlunarskóli Íslands (Commercial College of Iceland) * Performer: Sigurður Þór Óskarsson * Song: The Professor (Damien Rice) * 2nd place: Ingunn Kristjánsdóttir, Fjölbrautaskóla Norðurlands vestra * 3rd place: Dagur Sigurðsson, Fjölbrautaskólanum við Ármúla * 2009 – Fjölbrautarskóli Vesturlands * Performer: Kristín Þóra Jóhannsdóttir * Song: Einmanna sál (Angels – Robbie Williams) * 2010 – Borgarholtsskóli * Performers: Kristmundur Axel and Júlí Heiðar * Song: Komdu til baka – (Tears in Heaven) along with an original rap * 2nd place: Darri Rafn Hólmarsson and Rakel Sigurðardóttir, Menntaskólinn á Akureyri;

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowden_Run_3D",
    "content": "Snowden Run 3D is an endless runner video game created by Belgian computer programmer Michele Rocco Smeets. The program was released in July 2013 for Android operating systems, PC , and Mac computers. The game is very loosely based on NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden . ## Gameplay Snowden Run 3D plays as a free-to-play endless runner . Played in a behind the back, third person viewpoint , \"Snowden\" automatically runs forward, and the player must direct Snowden through the levels with swiping motions using a touch screen , to avoid obstacles and collect certain items. Specifically, the player is to direct Snowden into USB sticks and laptops in order to collect \"sensitive information\", while trying to avoid \"Agent Jake\", who chases after Snowden with the intent of imprisoning him. The player at times also has the option to call \" Uncle Putin \" on a cell phone, who will drop a hydrogen bomb on the location, which helps clear a path and further the distance between Snowden and Agent Jake. The game contains three different randomly generated levels ; NSA Headquarters, Hong Kong and Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport . The levels play out infinitely, with no way to win or finish. Upon inevitably being captured, Snowden is captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay , where the game ends. The game's soundtrack features music from Peruvian born American rapper and social activist Immortal Technique . ## Development The game was developed by programmer Michele Rocco Smeets, who states that the game took only 30 hours of development time. Smeets had noted how many spinoffs of Temple Run existed on the Google Play and iOS App Store , and was inspired to attempt to create one of his own. In early planning stages, at one point, he imagined the game as being more in the vein of a traditional platform game , such as Super Mario Bros. , but eventually felt that the constant running of an endless runner was more appropriate and symbolic of the nature of Edward Snowden and the NSA. The game was originally intended as a Ludum Dare entry, an accelerated video game development contest. Smeets states that the game is meant to be a neutral and unbiased parody of Edward Snowden 's involvement in the Global surveillance disclosures of 2013 , and was not made out of any political motivation or affiliation. A version of the game for iOS has been announced, but has not been released or given a release date. ## Reception Reception for the game was generally mixed. GameZone criticized the game for being difficult and buggy, but overall advocated at least giving the game a try as \"amusing way to pass time\", and compared it favorably to Hudson Soft 's Adventure Island video game from the 1980s. Kotaku was less enthusiastic, referring to the game as \"pretty awful\". * Official website",

    "title": "Castle of Monterrey",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Monterrey",
    "content": "The Castle of Monterrey is a 15th-century castle at Monterrei , in Ourense , Galicia. It is located at what was then a strategic point on the frontier between the kingdoms of Galicia and Portugal. It is now a hotel, part of the network of Paradores de Turismo de España . ## History Although Alfonso IX of León had built a fortress, in 1223, over the ruins of an old \"Castro de Baronceli\", re-naming it \"Monte Rey\" (King's Hill), his feud with the local monks, part of his feud with Pope Celestine III , led to it being demolished shortly thereafter. In 1262, his grandson, Alfonso X of Castile , also known as Alfonso the Wise, managed to establish a castle there. The buildings of the current castle date back to Sancho Sánchez de Ulloa (1442–1505), 1st Count of Monterrey, who built the 22-metre high keep, the \"Torre de Don Sancho\", in 1482, although the castle's other keep, the \"Torre das Damas\" (19 metres), was possibly built earlier. Major extensions, including convents for the orders of the Franciscans and the Jesuits, were later added in the 17th century by Philip IV of Spain 's military engineers, Juan de Villarroel and Carlos de Grunemberg. ### Peninsular War In the early stages of Marshal Soult 's Second French invasion of Portugal , the Spanish General La Romana had set up the headquarters of his Army of Galicia, numbering some 9,000 troops, at Monterrei where, at the Battle of Monterrey (6 – 7 March 1809), the French army the routed the Spanish forces. #### Background Soult, having left La Coruña and on his way to invade Portugal, had been unable to cross the Minho river which separates Galicia from Portugal. He had initially planned to do so at Tuy , but the weather conditions were against him, so he headed inland, towards Ourense , to the northeast. Still in Spain, this was the first point where there was a bridge over the river, but Soult knew that before penetrating the Portuguese border he would have to eliminate the threat of the Spanish forces stationed there. Following the rout of La Romana, Soult stayed on at Monterrei for three days waiting for his rearguard and his convoy of sick to join the main body of his forces, and then crossed the Portuguese frontier between Monterey and Chaves on 9 March, and headed towards Porto , laying siege to Chaves , which he captured on 12 March 1809. ### 21st century In 2015, the Xunta de Galicia signed a 75-year concession to the network of Paradores de Turismo de España . However, in 2016, the High Court of Justice of Galicia confirmed the annulment of the planning permission the Council of Monterrei had previously given for converting the castle into a hotel. It is now a hotel belonging to the network of Paradores . 41°56′49″N 7°26′58″W",

It is found on the east side of the island within the area of East Weares. Other piers within the area include King's Pier and Durdle Pier respectively. Folly Pier dates from the 17th century. ## History Folly Pier was once known as Old Pier, and was one of the main stone shipping places on the east side of Portland. The pier had been destroyed by the sea during the mid-18th century, but by 1765, a new pier on the site had been built. The limestone quarries of East and Penn's Weares were the location of Sir Christopher Wren 's first workings for stone to rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. The stone was shipped from the adjacent Durdle, Folly, and King's Piers. Once quarrying in the area was reduced, and quarries moved inland from the cliffs, the pier fell out of use, and any cranes were removed. The surrounding area was chosen for the site of Folly Pier Waterworks , which was built in 1855 by John Coode for the government. In addition to the pier and waterworks, a World War II pillbox is also located near the shoreline, next to pier. 50°33′12″N 2°25′03″W",

    "title": "Jörg Meyer-Stamer",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Meyer-Stamer",
    "content": "Jörg Meyer-Stamer was a German political scientist and economic development practitioner. He was passionate about developing economic development frameworks and methods that enabled stakeholders in developing countries to diagnose and improve their contexts. He developed methods and frameworks that enabled stakeholders to diagnose and improve local economic development , clusters, value chains and innovation systems. He also wrote several papers on structural change, technology, innovation and industrial policy. He worked in many developing countries to build local capacity, support local economic development and advise governments and international development organisations like the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit , International Labour Organization and Inter-American Development Bank . He was passionate about the industrial heritage and structural change programmes in Germany. He frequently hosted tour groups of decision-makers from developing countries in Germany to explore structural change, industrial heritage and local development issues. He was born on 30 October 1958 in Germany and he died on 1 May 2009. ## Early life and education He was born as Jörg Meyer , but he changed his surname to Meyer-Stamer during his early adulthood. He completed a master's degree (Diplom-Politologue) in Political Science at the University of Hamburg between 1979 and 1986. He completed a doctoral degree in 1995 at the University of Hamburg, Faculty of Social Sciences. Jörg was fluent in German, English, Portuguese and Spanish. ## Career He started his career in 1987 with the Hamburg University Computer Science Department as a research officer studying the impact of office automation systems on white-collar workers. During this time he became a visiting fellow at the Institute of Latin American Research in Hamburg. In 1988 he joined the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE/GDI) in Berlin as a fellow. He worked on industrial competitiveness, technological change, and private sector development. He had several research projects focused on Latin America. During this time he co-developed the framework of Systemic Competitiveness with Klaus Esser, Wolfgang Hillebrand and Dirk Messner. During his time at DIE/GDI he had several visiting fellowship appointments at other institutes such as Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex in Brighton (September to November 1994) and later at the Institut Arbeit und Technik, Gelsenkirchen, Germany (September to October 1996). During his last two years at the DIE/GDI (1997 to 1998), Jörg was appointed as the head of teaching at the GDI/DIE with overall topical and organizational responsibility of the postgraduate course. Following his death, the German Development Institute described Jörg as one of Germany's most creative and productive development researchers In 1998, he joined the Institute for Development and Peace at the University of Duisburg. He led a project to assess and evaluate the overall performance of structural policy in North Rhine-Westphalia . During this time, he represented Germany on the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development . He worked on a project with the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex on the impact of global value chains on local clusters. But Jörg felt constrained by the demands of the academic and research world, and in 2001 he ventured out as a freelance consultant. He maintained his links to his previous research networks but focused more on capacity building and method development in the developing world. In 2003, he was a founding partner of the consultancy firm Mesopartner. Although he became a consultant, he continued to publish academic and research papers. As a consultant, his attention shifted more towards capacity building on experts and decision-makers in developing countries, especially on topics like local economic development, cluster promotion and innovation systems promotion. ## Work Jorg worked in many developing countries to build local capacity, support local economic development and to advise governments and international development organisations like the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit , International Labour Organization and Inter-American Development Bank . ### Systemic competitiveness Together with Klaus Esser, Wolfgang Hillebrand, and Dirk Messner, Jörg Meyer-Stamer developed the concept of \"systemic competitiveness\". The DIE-GDI described the concept of systemic competitiveness as having a key impact on the discussion, both in Germany and internationally, on strategies suited to integrating developing countries into the world economy. ### Local economic development Jörg was a strong proponent of local economic development (LED). He was a vocal critic of planning driven LED approaches. He argued that a planning driven approach would sideline local stakeholders, and put the responsibility on the shoulder of local government. He claimed that LED is a learning approach and that this learning takes place as local stakeholders from different spheres work together to address local problems and opportunities. The strengthening of local trust and a focus on addressing local market failures was a theme throughout his work. He also suggested that a light touch approach focused on quick win activities is more suitable to start a local economic development process, and once the process is more mature and established a more planning driven approach involving more project management could be introduced. The concepts Jörg developed have strongly influenced the work of international development organisations such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit and the Inter American Development Bank (IADB). ### Participatory Appraisal of Competitive Advantage (PACA) Jörg developed the Participatory Appraisal of Competitive Advantage (PACA) methodology. It is a participatory process methodology that enables local stakeholders to jointly diagnose and improve their local economy. A typical PACA exercise could be undertaken within a week or two. A PACA exercise combines interviews with local stakeholders and analytical workshops, and it aims to mobilise or draw in a diverse range of local stakeholders in the diagnosis. The exercise is concluded with a way-forward workshop where local stakeholders commit to implementing quick win activities to improve the local economy. The PACA methodology has been used in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Ghana, Argentina, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. ### Rapid Appraisal of Local Innovation Systems (RALIS) Jörg developed the RALIS methodology based on material developed for his doctoral thesis and his earlier work at the German Development Institute. He combined insights from the study of technological capability, the emerging field of innovation systems with his experience in local economic development. Whereas innovation systems are typically studied in an ex-post manner by scholars, RALIS was a participatory method that enabled stakeholders or champions within an innovation system to diagnose and improve their system in an ex-ante approach. His work was influenced by the work of Friedrich List , Christopher Freeman , Sanjaya Lall and Bengt-Ake Lundvall . In 2005 Jörg co-authored a working paper with Christian Schoen that formalised the methodology. ## Books Esser, K., Hillebrand, W., Messner, D. and Meyer-Stamer, J. 1996. Systemic Competitiveness.

    "title": "Martin Degville",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Degville",
    "content": "Martin Degville (born 27 January 1961 ) is the lead vocalist and co-songwriter of the British new wave band Sigue Sigue Sputnik , which had a worldwide hit single in 1986 with \" Love Missile F1-11 \" and six other EMI single releases. Sigue Sigue Sputnik was formed with ex- Generation X bassist Tony James . ## Biography Degville hails from Walsall and was a familiar face on the Birmingham club scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s at clubs such as The Rum Runner and The Hosteria (Wine Bar). Before Sigue Sigue Sputnik (SSS) he had worked selling clothes, and he was spotted by Tony James and Neal X while dancing in his Yaya boutique. Degville's former flatmate is Boy George , and George worked in Degville's shop (Degville's Dispensary) during the time that he lived in Walsall. Degville was also a fashion designer who styled Sigue Sigue Sputnik's original image, and musical style. ### Solo career Following the initial split of SSS in 1990, Martin Degville started working with guitarist Mick Rossi (from the band, Slaughter & the Dogs) with a view to producing material as a solo artist. A new single going by the title of “I Surrender” was recorded which Degville and Rossi debuted on the Sky TV show “Hit Studio International”. However, an official release did not materialise. Before the year was out, Degville appeared on the late night TV Show “Timeshift” presented by Jono Coleman, performing another track, “Nuclear Powered Sex Machine”. During the interview with Coleman, Degville advised that he had written enough material for two albums but first, the aforementioned track was to be included on a six-track EP/mini-album entitled World War 4 and was to be released in the New Year via Trojan Records. The expected EP did not see the light of day but in 1991, World War 4 was released as a 10-track vinyl/13-track CD solo album through Receiver Records (a subsidiary of Trojan). An immediate follow-up album was in the pipeline and in 1992, Degville promoted the fact through his fan club with the intention of releasing the track “Techno Crash” as a limited edition 12” to fan club members. However, this release did not come to fruition although the song was reworked and included on the Jungle Records SSS album The First Generation – Second Edition in 1994. Aside of some ad hoc SSS recordings in the mid-90s, Degville returned to performing with Tony James and Neal X in 1998 which led to three new SSS studio albums being released between 2000 and 2003. Degville then formally left SSS in the summer of 2003. Degville has since recorded and performed material under the names Sputnik 2 - The Future, Sci-Fi-Superstars and Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic but from time to time has released further recordings under his own name (including the 2018 release of \"Spirit in the Sky\"). ### Sputnik 2 – The Future After Degville had decided to leave SSS, it was not long before he had set up his own website and set about performing and releasing music under the moniker of “Sputnik 2 – The Future” (although sometimes shortened to \"Sputnik2\"). In 2004, a new six-track EP entitled Smart1 was released. The EP featured 4 previously unreleased Degville tracks which included “World War 4”, “Psychodelik”, “Slag in the Back (Of My Cadilliac)” and “Don’t Dabble with the Devil”. Sputnik 2 undertook some short sets to promote the Smart1 EP with a number of different backing musicians including the two-piece band Dead Heaven. Subsequently, in 2005, Degville started to work with the Scottish production duo \"DiSCOKiNGZ\" (a.k.a. DV8), Paul Fitzgerald and Stephen Buxey. They introduced a new track to the set, “Planet Bi”. DiSCOKiNGZ went on to record, produce and remix versions of “Don’t Dabble with the Devil” and “Planet Bi”. DiSCOKiNGZ also toured with Degville as part of the Sputnik2 band. ### Sci-Fi Superstars During 2005, Degville appeared on the BBC TV show Never Mind the Buzzcocks and confirmed that he was working on his new project, “Sci-Fi Superstars”. In February 2006, the album It’s So Chic to be a Sci-Fi Freak was released. In 2008, Degville started a collaboration with the Spanish brothers David and Santi Lluch, also known as The Hellbilly Club. However, it was not until 2009 that Degville announced that this collaboration was to now be formally taken forward under the band name of Sci-Fi Superstars with the 15-track Prophet of Freak album released in April. ### Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic Midway through 2009, Degville started to play live as Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic (SSSE) alongside Johann Weidemann (who took on the keyboards/FX). In April 2011, a re-recorded mastered version of “Flaunt it” was released, produced by producer/remixer Lloyd Price. in June 2011, a limited 16-track mastered CD-R entitled Revisited was released which included a track called \"Fascination\" (originally a demo during the Sputnik 2 era) and a new, slower version of \"Don't Dabble...\" entitled \"Unknown Soul\" re-envisaged by Lloyd. A selection of re-recorded tracks from the Degville/SSS back catalogue made up the other tracks. October 2012 saw the release of Electronic DNA , an album full of new songs produced by Lloyd Price who was responsible for the co-writing of numerous tracks on the album. Two video trailers were launched on YouTube over a three-week period prior to the release by Price, with the first showcasing a snippet of the track \"Terror Bytes\" and the second mixing a number of the songs. The album was formally released in both download and limited-edition mastered CD-R formats. Electronic DNA was the last full album release under the SSSE name. SSSE released a 12\" vinyl single entitled \"Timex Kid\" in 2015. ## Solo discography ### Solo/Martin Degville Albums * 1991 World War Four (10-track vinyl and cassette/13-track CD released via Receiver Records) * 2008 Guns, Oil, Drugs (11-track CDR self-release featuring unmastered tracks) * 2008 Sputnik 2 – The Future (nine-track CDR and digital self-release featuring unmastered tracks) * 2014 Demolition (12-track digital self-release featuring unmastered tracks) * 2016 The Collective (12-track digital self-release featuring unmastered tracks) Extended plays * 2008 The Good, the Bad & the Fabulous (four-track CDR given away free with a DVD package) * 2012 Unplugged (four-track digital-only release) * 2018 Spirit in the Sky (10-track digital-only remix package released in 2018, followed by a nine-track \"Part 2\" remix package in 2019) ### Sputnik 2 Extended plays * 2004 Smart1 (six-track studio-mastered self-release) ### Sci-Fi Superstars Albums * 2006 It's So Chic to Be a Sci-Fi Freak (18-track CD-R self-release) * 2009 Space Age Junkie (eight-track digital-only release including mastered tracks and demos not included on \"Prophet of Freak\" album) * 2009 Prophet of Freak (CD-R and digital self-release; fully mastered 15-track album plus two bonus tracks given away digitally) ### Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic Albums * 2011 Flaunt It (10-track CD-R and digital download) * 2011 Revisited (16-track limited edition CD-R and 15-track digital download) * 2012 Electronic DNA (10-track CD-R and digital download) * 2013 Electronic DNA - The Remixes (16-track digital download) Extended plays * 2009 Sputnik vs Bowie (initially a six-track CD-R and digital download albeit in 2012, a further two tracks were included on the digital download via Reverbnation) * 2010 Futuatronik (four-track CD-R and digital download) * 2011 Fascination - The Remixes (Part 1) (eight-track digital-only release) * 2011 Fascination - The Remixes (Part 2) (seven-track digital-only release) * 2013 Cover to Covers (five-track digital-only release) * 2013 Resurrection (four-track digital-only release) * 2014 Love Missile F1-11 2014 - The Remixes (17-track digital-only release) * 2015 Where Have All The Rock Stars Gone? - The Remixes (12-track digital-only release) * 2015 Timex Kid (four-track 12\" and six-track digital release) ## Other commercial releases * 2007 \"Planet Bi (Pilgrim Omega)\": Martin Degville (track included on the various-artists compilation album, “Electraparade”) * 2008 \"I Fought the Law\": Bettie Ford featuring Martin Degville (B-side to the \"One for the Road\" single) * 2008 \"21st Century Boy\": The Hellbilly Club featuring Martin Degville (track on the \"No More Parasites\" album) * 2015 She's Outta Fashion: Banshee featuring Martin Degville (two-track digital-only release) * Official Facebook page * Sigue Sigue Sputnik official site, Degville's previous work * Martin Degville/Blitz Kids Site * DiSCOKiNGZ * Martin Degville at AllMusic * Martin Degville discography at Discogs * Martin Degville at IMDb",

    "title": "Stop the Train",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_Train",
    "content": "Stop the Train is a 2001 children's novel by Geraldine McCaughrean . It won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Bronze Award, as well as being shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal and the Stockton Children's Book of the Year . ## Plot summary During the Oklahoma Land Run , Cissy and her parents arrive from the east to settle in Florence Town, a new settlement. Within a few days, it becomes apparent that a local railroad company wants to use the land for itself and attempts to purchase it from the people of the town. The townspeople do not want to sell their land, and the director of the railroad company announces that no trains will stop at the town. Suffering hardship through having no railroad connection, the townspeople decide to make efforts – both legal and illegal – to stop the train that passes through their town. The story documents the life of Cissy as she grows and the struggles of the people in the town to make some sort of living. The townsfolk hold a fair to show their community off to a trainload of passengers, hijacked by a group of the town's men. Following the success of the Florence Fair, the passengers pressurise the railroad company to stop ignoring Florence, and boycott the trains. The people of Florence are unaware of this, being so cut off from the rest of Oklahoma, and rumours of a young girl's death under the wheels of a train spark a sabotage of the railway – a length of rail is removed, blocking the road crossing. Realising what damage they might cause and that the people on the train were not the ones responsible for their plight, the townspeople manage to reconstruct the track before the train comes through, thereby averting disaster. They discover the train company has relented and will stop at their station. To pay tribute to the town's new start, and in a gesture of reconciliation towards the railroad company, Florence is renamed Olive, hence the \"Olive Branch Line\". The book may be partly influenced by the Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War , and is dedicated to the people of Enid, \"who did stop the train\". ## Sequel Cissy's story continues in Pull Out All the Stops! (2010), known in the US as The Glorious Adventures of the Sunshine Queen , in which she stays with her former teacher, Miss Loucien, on board an old showboat which hosts the Bright Lights Theatre Company.",

    "title": "Taranto FC 1927",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranto_FC_1927",
    "content": "Taranto Football Club 1927 , commonly referred to as Taranto , is a professional Italian football club, based in Taranto , Apulia . Originally founded in 1927 by the union of two pioneering clubs that created the first city squad, Taranto currently plays in Serie C Group C. Taranto is 19th in the all-time Serie B ranking, though Taranto has not played in Serie B since 1993 , having played in the \"serie cadetta\" 31 times, more than any other Italian club which never played in Serie A. ## History ### A.S. Taranto The first team ever founded in the city of Taranto was the Mario Rapisardi , established in 1904. However, in 1904 another team, U.S. Pro Italia , was founded. That year, the two teams attempted unsuccessfully to merge with each other. In 1911, after the founding of Audace Foot Ball Club by a group of local students, a rivalry between the two teams started, lasting until 1927, when the two teams merged to form A.S. Taranto . The new team first promoted to Serie B in 1935, played only one year in that category. In 1947, after merging with U.S. Arsenale Taranto , another team in the city, the club assumed the name of U.S. Arsenaltaranto , which lasted until 1955, when the old one was restored. In 1965, the new venue was inaugurated, after a hundred days of construction. A number of years played in Serie B and Serie C saw the highest peak ever reached by Taranto in 1977–1978, when the team, led by striker Erasmo Iacovone , was seriously fighting for a surprising promotion. However, on 6 February 1978, Iacovone was killed in a car accident. After his death, Taranto's venue was named after him. Taranto left Serie B in 1980/1981 and reached it again three years later. In 1985 the club was declared bankrupt by magistrates, and was taken over before the end of that season. Because of all that, it was forced to change its name to a different one, Taranto Football Club SpA . However, after more economic woes, the team was disbanded in 1993. ### Another club A new team, named Taranto Calcio 1906 , was established in 1993 and registered to Serie D by the FIGC . The team reached Serie C2/C in 1994/1995, but went into liquidation in 1998, so that a new team, again named U.S. Arsenaltaranto , was admitted to Serie D. In 2000 it was admitted to Serie C2/C, and changed its name to Taranto Calcio Srl . However, in 2004 the team was declared bankrupt one more time, and the consequent bankruptcy auction entrusted the club in the hands of businessman Vito Luigi Blasi, who changed its name in Taranto Sport Srl . In 2005/2006, the team ended second, gaining a spot in the promotion play-offs. The final phase of the Serie C2/C league ended in a triumph for Taranto Sport, which won the playoff finals against Rende and returned to Serie C1/B . On 29 June 2012 it was excluded from Italian professional football and did not take its place in the 2012–13 championship of Lega Pro Prima Divisione . ### Taranto Football Club 1927 On 20 July 2012 the new company Taranto Football Club 1927 S.p.A. was established. It restarted from the Serie D (Girone H) thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F. In 2013 the team finished 7th in the league. In 2014 it ended the season in second place and lost to Arezzo in the play-offs. The next season ended in similar fashion, with Taranto ending the season in second place and losing in the play-offs semifinal to Sestri Levante . In 2015 the club was renamed to Società Sportiva Dilettantistica Taranto Football Club 1927 . In 2016 the team finished the season in second place and lost in the play-offs to Fondi , but eventually benefitted from a repechage and promoted to Lega Pro . The following season Taranto finished 20th in Lega Pro/C and thus got relegated back to Serie D after just one season. In 2017–18 the team finished 4th in Serie D/H and lost to Cavese the playoff final. A year later the team finished 3rd in Serie D/H but again lost in the playoff final, this time to Audace Cerignola . The team finished 6th in 2019–20 Serie D/H , thus failing to qualify for the playoffs. In 2020-21 , Taranto finished in first place in Group H , thus securing promotion to Serie C. In the 2024–25 Serie C season, Taranto experienced financial difficulties. It failed to pay salaries and fees, and suffered consecutive point deductions as punishment, with 19 points deducted by late January 2025, taking the last spot in the table with negative 6 points. However, they continued to play (fielding their Under-19 squad, and playing home games behind closed doors), as dropping out of the competition would mean they would not be allowed to play in Serie D in the 2025–26 season. In the end, this was not enough and the club was excluded from the 2024–25 Serie C season on 7 March 2025.

    "title": "Merzak Allouache",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merzak_Allouache",
    "content": "Merzak Allouache (born 6 October 1940) is an Algerian film director and screenwriter . His 1976 film Omar Gatlato was later entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Silver Prize. His 1996 Salut cousin! was submitted to the 69th Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film . He is one of the most influential Algerian filmmakers, considered by some to be the most important. He is the only Algerian filmmaker who devoted most, if not all, of his cinematic work to his native country. ## Early life Merzak Allouache was born in the Algiers neighborhood of Bab el-Oued . His father was a Kabyle Berber postal worker and his mother was an Algerian housewife from Casbah . Allouache was only ten years old when the Algerian Liberation War began in 1954 and he was only eighteen during the year of independence in 1962. ## Career ### Studies Merzak Allouache began his studies in 1964 at the Institute for Cinema in Algiers. While there, he directed his graduation film, Croisement , as well as a short film, Le Voleur . When the Institute for Cinema closed, the students were redirected to Lodz or Paris . Allouache completed his studies at l’IDHEC (now called La Fémis ) in Paris. ### News career Returning to Algeria, he spent a few months at the Algerian News Office and then was dismissed, along with his colleagues from the Institute for Cinema’s graduating class after a petition demanding more responsibility for the workers. To calm the protest, the group of alumni of the Institute for Cinema including Allouache was sent to France for a three-month internship at the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF). He remained in France for several years and enrolled at the École pratique des hautes études with Marc Ferro and took the course \"Analysis of 20th century film documents\". ### Film career Allouache returned to Algeria in 1973 and worked on organizing CinéBus campaigns in support of the agrarian revolution. He worked as an advisor for the Ministry of Culture. He directed a documentary film about this work called Nous et la révolution agraire ( Us and the Agrarian Revolution ) in 1972. In 1974, he co-directed for the Office National pour le Commerce et l'Industrie Cinématographique (ONCIC) Tipasa l'ancienne , a documentary on the site of Tipasa , in co-production with FR3 Marseille. Before joining ONCIC as a director in 1975, he was assistant director on Le Vent du Sud directed by Mohamed Slim Riad, also in 1974. He gained international fame in 1977 by directing his first feature film Omar Gatlato (1976), which takes a cynical but realistic look at the alienation of men in Algerian society, which was selected at the Semaine de la Critique in Cannes and won a Silver Medal at the Moscow Film Festival . Then he directed Les Aventures d'un héros in 1978, a film about an Algerian father who falsely labels his infant son as the hero his tribe has been waiting for, which received the Thanit d'or at the Carthage Film Festival , and directed L'Homme qui regardait les fenêtres in 1982. Allouache returned to France and wrote a screenplay for TF1 , Parlez après le signal sonore , and, in 1987, directed a feature film Un amour à Paris , a love story about two Algerians: a model and an ex-con, screened in the Perspectives of French Cinema section at the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Perspectives of French Cinema Prize. He returned to Algeria in 1988 in the aftermath of the October riots . He filmed video documentaries on the political situation with many interviews that were gathered in three documentaries for ARTE : L'Après-Octobre , Femmes en mouvements , and Vie et mort des journalistes algériens . In 1989, he directed a satirical program for Algerian television, La Boîte à chique , and then joined the National Audiovisual Council, a structure in charge of reforming cinematography when the Ministry of Culture was dissolved. In 1992, he directed a documentary for the BBC , Our War, Voice of Ramadan . In 1993, as Algeria sank into violence, he directed in extremis a feature film, Bab El-Oued City which follows the conflict between a young Algerian man and the local Islamic fundamentalists, screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival. He was forced to leave for France once again in the 1990s due to dangerous conditions for working artists In 1996, he directed a film about two cousins navigating racism in Paris, Salut Cousin , which was screened in the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival, won a Thanit d'or at the Carthage Film Festival, and was submitted to the 69th Academy Awards . After directing a series of films and TV movies, he returned to Algeria in 1999. Since 2000, Allouache has alternated his productions or co-productions between Algeria and France, where he lives. In 2003, he directed Chouchou , starring Gad Elmaleh , about a Maghrebi transgender woman who settles in Paris to find her nephew. He directed Bab el-Web in 2004, a comedy about the effects of the internet on Algerian youth. This film was partially funded by French sources, with the stipulation that at least fifty-one percent of the dialogue be recorded in French, despite the fact that all of the characters were Algerian. In 2009, Allouache wrote and directed the film Harragas , the story of young Algerian refugees who fled their home country on small boats into the Mediterranean. The film was partly funded by the Algerian government. However, they did not like the end result and the Algerian government has subsequently boycotted Allouache’s films and refused further support. His 2011 film, Normal! , about a filmmaker in the aftermath of the December riots , won the award for Best Film at the 2011 Doha Tribeca Film Festival. This film was a commentary on the Algerian government’s amnesty policy for terrorists. In 2012 he directed Le repenti ( The Repentant ), a film about an Islamist released from prison who struggles to understand forgiveness, which was screened at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival. It won a FIPRESCI Award at the 17th International Film Festival of Kerala . In 2013 Les terrasses ( The Rooftops ) about life in Bab el-Oued, was screened at the Venice Film Festival and in 2015 Madame courage , about a drug-user who tries to kick his habit, was screened at the Venice Film Festival. In 2016 a documentary fiction Enquête au paradis , which combines in-person interviews with a dramatized road trip was screened at the FIPA in Biarritz (Fipa d'or) at the Berlin Film Festival , and in 2017 Vent divin was screened at the Toronto Film Festival . ## Awards His 2011 film Normal! won the award for Best Film at the 2011 Doha Tribeca Film Festival .

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_S.O.S._with_Jo_Frost",
    "content": "Family S.O.S. with Jo Frost is an American reality television series that premiered May 28, 2013, on TLC . In contrast from Frost’s previous show Supernanny , which focuses mainly on toddlers, in this series Frost helps families of all ages. From parents contemplating divorce, angsty teenagers, family disputes, to tormenting in school. The series covers a multitude of problems that many families face. ## Synopsis Much like her original series, Supernanny , Jo visits homes of families who need assistance with instilling peace within the home. Unlike her original series, Jo helps families of any age, size or structure — not just children. It gives an insight to solving some of the issues created in part by the 21st century such as cyberbullying , abuse, and addiction. ## Episodes No.TitleOriginal release dateU.S. viewers (millions)1\"If This Doesn't Work, It's Over\"May 28, 2013 (2013-05-28)1.15 In the 90-minute series premiere, Jo arrives at the home of the Quinn-Davises. Both parents have children from previous marriages, and tension has reached a limit. Their daughters Emily and Amber have chosen not to follow the rules or give their parents respect. Their son Derek has become low-spirited due to all the fighting within the home. Chad has overcome his addiction, initially believing that the presence of Jo is staged, and is recovering. Julie and Don, the parents, each defend their children — which sets a divide that is heading towards divorce. While Jo is visiting, Chad receives some horrifying news regarding a close friend and Amber struggles with alcohol consumption.2\"I Told You Not to Bring That ONE Thing Up!\"June 4, 2013 (2013-06-04)0.87 Jo arrives to help the Mead Family, who live in Westlake Village, California. Tara, 47, David, 44, constantly fight and argue in front of their three young kids, Peyton, Roman and Austin who have disciplinary issues and who call names and swear. They are also sensitive to their parents' fighting. Meanwhile Ashlynn, Tara and David's teenage daughter was recently caught with cigarettes and condoms, and has a torn relationship with her dad, often fighting and arguing with him.3\"He's Scared of You...All the Children Are\"June 11, 2013 (2013-06-11)0.89 Jo Frost heads to the Campos Family in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Brandy and George have five children. The couple have issues in regards to raising their kids, Brandy is at her wits end dealing with the children, while George has a short fuse and finds himself bullying and hitting the children. Some of the children have issues of their own. Blake is getting bullied at school, he finally snapped and is now in trouble with the law. Corey has Down Syndrome and struggles with potty training, he often defecates on himself, In response, George shames him and sprays him with water.4\"Finger Pointing and Blah, Blah, Blah!\"June 18, 2013 (2013-06-18)0.73 Jo is called to Los Angeles to help relieve the tension in the Mitchell Family. Kay and Mitch aren't on the same page in regards to discipline. Mitch prefers to bribe the kids. Their conflicting personalities result in arguments which affects their children. Especially eldest son Cameron who resents his parents and takes his anger out on his brother.5\"You're NOT My Mother\"June 25, 2013 (2013-06-25)0.79 Jo arrives in Manhattan Beach to help the Bross Family. Dad Larry works in Las Vegas and is only home on weekends, but feels that their daughters need boundaries and consequences. Mom Debbie does not believe in consequences or discipline, which leads to their daughters acting out. Their daughters Addisyn (14) and twins Abrielle and Alysse (11) are adopted and Debbie is fearful that giving consequences will push them further away. The twins are unruly and often point out that Debbie and Larry are not their parents.6\"This Isn't Love\"July 2, 2013 (2013-07-02)0.52 Jo travels to Cypress, California, to assist the non-traditional Coburn-Hunter family. Chris Hunter and Crystle Coburn are not married. Crystle has a daughter, Austoria (22), who is a lesbian. Crystle does not accept Austoria's sexuality or her girlfriend. Additionally, Crystle has a son, Daeryan, with whom she does not have a relationship. Chris and Crystle also have a son together, Trebian. Chris cheated on Crystle when they first began dating, which has led to Crystle’s lack of trust and forgiveness towards him, causing hostility within the family.",

    "title": "South Station Tower",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Station_Tower",
    "content": "South Station Tower is a skyscraper under construction in Boston, Massachusetts , the high-rise portion of a three-building development. Construction on Phase 1 of the project, a 51-story, 678-foot tower with offices and condominiums, started in January 2020 and was expected to take four years. It is being built atop Boston's historic South Station complex, an example of transit-oriented development . The overall project will include condominium units, office space, a parking structure, and possibly hotel space. The property was initially proposed by Hines Interests and TUDC, a subsidiary of Tufts University . Part of Phase I, an expanded bus station, will use a foundation put in place when the station was last renovated in the late 1980s. The high-rise tower will be supported by a new foundation constructed in the area between the existing station and the tracks. Foot traffic will be rerouted around construction areas. ## History South Station Tower was planned to break ground in 2008, with completion scheduled to occur in 2010, but the project stalled. Approval has been obtained for a project totaling 2,190,000 square feet (203,000 m 2 ). As of March 2016 the developer's website was updated stating the tower would begin construction early in 2017; the FAA had given approval in February for a tower reaching 677 feet (206 m)}. The developer's rights to build on the site were scheduled to expire in April 2017, but the state extended them until the end of the year. Construction was halted due to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)'s concerns, but Hines did not stop the project. Development of the airspace above the southbound tracks has been delayed several times. The building was conceived by Tufts president Jean Mayer , who foresaw an \"epicenter of high-profile medical research\" in downtown Boston. In 1991, Tufts created a for-profit development subsidiary, TUDC LLC, and acquired the rights to the airspace. Development over the past decade has been complicated by Boston waterfront zoning restrictions, which require pedestrian access to the waterfront. In 1997, TUDC brought on Hines Interests LP as a development partner. In 2006, TUDC and Hines filed a Development Plan for the project. Questions were raised in 2007 about the university's role in the project, and Tufts withdrew in 2009. South Station Tower was originally designed with a height of 759 feet (231 m), which included a decorative spire. However, the project was downscaled in 2006. In July 2016, the developer filed a \"Notice of Project Change\" with the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), proposing a number of changes in the project, including the addition of more residential space. The notice included a timeline calling for construction of the project's first building, the high-rise tower, to begin in 2017. In December 2016, the board of the BPDA approved construction of the project. It was delayed until December 2017, then delayed again in 2018 due to MBTA concerns on the tower's potential operational and maintenance cost, in addition to its capital expenditure and the way it was distributed among the project stakeholders. In October that year, MBTA extended the negotiation period with Hines until April 2019. Construction officially began in January 2020, with a five year completion timeline. By November 2022, ENR East reported that the building's steel frame had reached a height of 109 feet (33 m). ### Accidents On March 21, 2024, a steel beam fell from the top of the tower, damaging several windows, before coming to rest on the ninth floor. Some equipment from the worksite also fell, landing at street-level. The MBTA , who owns South Station and the South Station Bus Terminal, suspended commuter services and ordered work to halt in the time after the incident. No injuries were reported, but construction company Suffolk agreed to pause work while investigations proceeded. Construction work resumed on March 27, 2024 following the conclusion of the stop-work order and subsequent investigations by OSHA. On April 9, 2024, A few weeks after the beam fell, a fire was started outside the ninth floor by welders. The fire was quickly put out and the site was again shut down for a safety review. Work on the site was then continued on April 10, 2024. ## Design Preliminary design was done by architect Cesar Pelli , whose designs are reminiscent of his Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis . The structure has been LEED pre-certified \"silver\" and won the EPA's \"Green design\" award. * List of tallest buildings in Boston Media related to South Station Tower at Wikimedia Commons * Developer website * Architecture Boston on project * South Station Air Rights website 42.351583°N 71.054972°W",

    "title": "Clifford analysis",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_analysis",
    "content": "Clifford analysis , using Clifford algebras named after William Kingdon Clifford , is the study of Dirac operators , and Dirac type operators in analysis and geometry, together with their applications. Examples of Dirac type operators include, but are not limited to, the Hodge–Dirac operator, d + ⋆ d ⋆ {\\displaystyle d+{\\star }d{\\star }} on a Riemannian manifold , the Dirac operator in euclidean space and its inverse on C 0 ∞ ( R n ) {\\displaystyle C_{0}^{\\infty }(\\mathbf {R} ^{n})} and their conformal equivalents on the sphere, the Laplacian in euclidean n -space and the Atiyah –Singer–Dirac operator on a spin manifold, Rarita–Schwinger/Stein–Weiss type operators, conformal Laplacians, spinorial Laplacians and Dirac operators on Spin C manifolds , systems of Dirac operators, the Paneitz operator , Dirac operators on hyperbolic space , the hyperbolic Laplacian and Weinstein equations. ## Euclidean space In Euclidean space the Dirac operator has the form D = ∑ j = 1 n e j ∂ ∂ x j {\\displaystyle D=\\sum _{j=1}^{n}e_{j}{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}}} where e 1 , ..., e n is an orthonormal basis for R n , and R n is considered to be embedded in a complex Clifford algebra , Cl n ( C ) so that e j 2 = −1 . This gives D 2 = − Δ n {\\displaystyle D^{2}=-\\Delta _{n}} where Δ n is the Laplacian in n -euclidean space. The fundamental solution to the euclidean Dirac operator is G ( x − y ) := 1 ω n x − y ‖ x − y ‖ n {\\displaystyle G(x-y):={\\frac {1}{\\omega _{n}}}{\\frac {x-y}{\\|x-y\\|^{n}}}} where ω n is the surface area of the unit sphere S n −1 . Note that D 1 ( n − 2 ) ω n ‖ x − y ‖ n − 2 = G ( x − y ) {\\displaystyle D{\\frac {1}{(n-2)\\omega _{n}\\|x-y\\|^{n-2}}}=G(x-y)} where 1 ( n − 2 ) ω n ‖ x − y ‖ n − 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{(n-2)\\;\\omega _{n}\\;\\|x-y\\|^{n-2}}}} is the fundamental solution to Laplace's equation for n ≥ 3 . The most basic example of a Dirac operator is the Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂ ∂ x + i ∂ ∂ y {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x}}+i{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial y}}} in the complex plane. Indeed, many basic properties of one variable complex analysis follow through for many first order Dirac type operators. In euclidean space this includes a Cauchy Theorem , a Cauchy integral formula , Morera's theorem , Taylor series , Laurent series and Liouville Theorem . In this case the Cauchy kernel is G ( x − y ). The proof of the Cauchy integral formula is the same as in one complex variable and makes use of the fact that each non-zero vector x in euclidean space has a multiplicative inverse in the Clifford algebra, namely − x ‖ x ‖ 2 ∈ R n . {\\displaystyle -{\\frac {x}{\\|x\\|^{2}}}\\in \\mathbf {R} ^{n}.} Up to a sign this inverse is the Kelvin inverse of x . Solutions to the euclidean Dirac equation Df = 0 are called (left) monogenic functions. Monogenic functions are special cases of harmonic spinors on a spin manifold . In 3 and 4 dimensions Clifford analysis is sometimes referred to as quaternionic analysis. When n = 4 , the Dirac operator is sometimes referred to as the Cauchy–Riemann–Fueter operator. Further some aspects of Clifford analysis are referred to as hypercomplex analysis. Clifford analysis has analogues of Cauchy transforms , Bergman kernels , Szegő kernels , Plemelj operators , Hardy spaces , a Kerzman–Stein formula and a Π, or Beurling–Ahlfors , transform. These have all found applications in solving boundary value problems , including moving boundary value problems, singular integrals and classic harmonic analysis . In particular Clifford analysis has been used to solve, in certain Sobolev spaces , the full water wave problem in 3D. This method works in all dimensions greater than 2. Much of Clifford analysis works if we replace the complex Clifford algebra by a real Clifford algebra , Cl n . This is not the case though when we need to deal with the interaction between the Dirac operator and the Fourier transform . ## The Fourier transform When we consider upper half space R n ,+ with boundary R n −1 , the span of e 1 , ..., e n −1 , under the Fourier transform the symbol of the Dirac operator D n − 1 = ∑ j = 1 n − 1 ∂ ∂ x j {\\displaystyle D_{n-1}=\\sum _{j=1}^{n-1}{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}}} is iζ where ζ = ζ 1 e 1 + ⋯ + ζ n − 1 e n − 1 . {\\displaystyle \\zeta =\\zeta _{1}e_{1}+\\cdots +\\zeta _{n-1}e_{n-1}.} In this setting the Plemelj formulas are ± 1 2 + G ( x − y ) | R n − 1 {\\displaystyle \\pm {\\tfrac {1}{2}}+G(x-y)|_{\\mathbf {R} ^{n-1}}} and the symbols for these operators are, up to a sign, 1 2 ( 1 ± i ζ ‖ ζ ‖ ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}\\left(1\\pm i{\\frac {\\zeta }{\\|\\zeta \\|}}\\right).} These are projection operators, otherwise known as mutually annihilating idempotents, on the space of Cl n ( C ) valued square integrable functions on R n −1 . Note that G | R n = ∑ j = 1 n − 1 e j R j {\\displaystyle G|_{\\mathbf {R} ^{n}}=\\sum _{j=1}^{n-1}e_{j}R_{j}} where R j is the j -th Riesz potential, x j ‖ x ‖ n . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {x_{j}}{\\|x\\|^{n}}}.} As the symbol of G | R n {\\displaystyle G|_{\\mathbf {R} ^{n}}} is i ζ ‖ ζ ‖ {\\displaystyle {\\frac {i\\zeta }{\\|\\zeta \\|}}} it is easily determined from the Clifford multiplication that ∑ j = 1 n − 1 R j 2 = 1. {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j=1}^{n-1}R_{j}^{2}=1.} So the convolution operator G | R n {\\displaystyle G|_{\\mathbf {R} ^{n}}} is a natural generalization to euclidean space of the Hilbert transform . Suppose U ′ is a domain in R n −1 and g ( x ) is a Cl n ( C ) valued real analytic function . Then g has a Cauchy–Kovalevskaia extension to the Dirac equation on some neighborhood of U ′ in R n . The extension is explicitly given by ∑ j = 0 ∞ ( x n e n − 1 D n − 1 ) j g ( x ) . {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j=0}^{\\infty }\\left(x_{n}e_{n}^{-1}D_{n-1}\\right)^{j}g(x).} When this extension is applied to the variable x in e − i ⟨ x , ζ ⟩ ( 1 2 ( 1 ± i ζ ‖ ζ ‖ ) ) {\\displaystyle e^{-i\\langle x,\\zeta \\rangle }\\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\left(1\\pm i{\\frac {\\zeta }{\\|\\zeta \\|}}\\right)\\right)} we get that e − i ⟨ x , ζ ⟩ {\\displaystyle e^{-i\\langle x,\\zeta \\rangle }} is the restriction to R n −1 of E + + E − where E + is a monogenic function in upper half space and E − is a monogenic function in lower half space. There is also a Paley–Wiener theorem in n -Euclidean space arising in Clifford analysis. ## Conformal structure Many Dirac type operators have a covariance under conformal change in metric. This is true for the Dirac operator in euclidean space, and the Dirac operator on the sphere under Möbius transformations. Consequently, this holds true for Dirac operators on conformally flat manifolds and conformal manifolds which are simultaneously spin manifolds . ### Cayley transform (stereographic projection) The Cayley transform or stereographic projection from R n to the unit sphere S n transforms the euclidean Dirac operator to a spherical Dirac operator D S . Explicitly D S = x ( Γ n + n 2 ) {\\displaystyle D_{S}=x\\left(\\Gamma _{n}+{\\frac {n}{2}}\\right)} where Γ n is the spherical Beltrami–Dirac operator ∑ 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + 1 e i e j ( x i ∂ ∂ x j − x j ∂ ∂ x i ) {\\displaystyle \\sum \\nolimits _{1\\leq i<j\\leq n+1}e_{i}e_{j}\\left(x_{i}{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}}-x_{j}{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x_{i}}}\\right)} and x in S n . The Cayley transform over n -space is y = C ( x ) = ( e n + 1 x + 1 ) ( x + e n + 1 ) − 1 , x ∈ R n . {\\displaystyle y=C(x)=(e_{n+1}x+1)(x+e_{n+1})^{-1},\\qquad x\\in \\mathbf {R} ^{n}.} Its inverse is x = ( − e n + 1 + 1 ) ( y − e n + 1 ) − 1 . {\\displaystyle x=(-e_{n+1}+1)(y-e_{n+1})^{-1}.} For a function f ( x ) defined on a domain U in n -euclidean space and a solution to the Dirac equation , then J ( C − 1 , y ) f ( C − 1 ( y ) ) {\\displaystyle J(C^{-1},y)f(C^{-1}(y))} is annihilated by D S , on C ( U ) where J ( C − 1 , y ) = y − e n + 1 ‖ y − e n + 1 ‖ n . {\\displaystyle J(C^{-1},y)={\\frac {y-e_{n+1}}{\\|y-e_{n+1}\\|^{n}}}.} Further D S ( D S − x ) = △ S , {\\displaystyle D_{S}(D_{S}-x)=\\triangle _{S},} the conformal Laplacian or Yamabe operator on S n . Explicitly △ S = − △ L B + 1 4 n ( n − 2 ) {\\displaystyle \\triangle _{S}=-\\triangle _{LB}+{\\tfrac {1}{4}}n(n-2)} where △ L B {\\displaystyle \\triangle _{LB}} is the Laplace–Beltrami operator on S n . The operator △ S {\\displaystyle \\triangle _{S}} is, via the Cayley transform, conformally equivalent to the euclidean Laplacian. Also D s ( D S − x ) ( D S − x ) ( D S − 2 x ) {\\displaystyle D_{s}(D_{S}-x)(D_{S}-x)(D_{S}-2x)} is the Paneitz operator, − △ S ( △ S + 2 ) , {\\displaystyle -\\triangle _{S}(\\triangle _{S}+2),} on the n -sphere. Via the Cayley transform this operator is conformally equivalent to the bi-Laplacian, △ n 2 {\\displaystyle \\triangle _{n}^{2}} . These are all examples of operators of Dirac type. ### Möbius transform A Möbius transform over n -euclidean space can be expressed as a x + b c x + d , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {ax+b}{cx+d}},} where a , b , c and d ∈ Cl n and satisfy certain constraints. The associated 2 × 2 matrix is called an Ahlfors–Vahlen matrix. If y = M ( x ) + a x + b c x + d {\\displaystyle y=M(x)+{\\frac {ax+b}{cx+d}}} and Df ( y ) = 0 then J ( M , x ) f ( M ( x ) ) {\\displaystyle J(M,x)f(M(x))} is a solution to the Dirac equation where J ( M , x ) = c x + d ~ ‖ c x + d ‖ n {\\displaystyle J(M,x)={\\frac {\\widetilde {cx+d}}{\\|cx+d\\|^{n}}}} and ~ is a basic antiautomorphism acting on the Clifford algebra . The operators D k , or Δ n k /2 when k is even, exhibit similar covariances under Möbius transform including the Cayley transform . When ax + b and cx + d are non-zero they are both members of the Clifford group . As a x + b c x + d = − a x − b − c x − d {\\displaystyle {\\frac {ax+b}{cx+d}}={\\frac {-ax-b}{-cx-d}}} then we have a choice in sign in defining J ( M , x ). This means that for a conformally flat manifold M we need a spin structure on M in order to define a spinor bundle on whose sections we can allow a Dirac operator to act. Explicit simple examples include the n -cylinder, the Hopf manifold obtained from n -euclidean space minus the origin, and generalizations of k -handled toruses obtained from upper half space by factoring it out by actions of generalized modular groups acting on upper half space totally discontinuously. A Dirac operator can be introduced in these contexts. These Dirac operators are special examples of Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operators. ## Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator Given a spin manifold M with a spinor bundle S and a smooth section s ( x ) in S then, in terms of a local orthonormal basis e 1 ( x ), ..., e n ( x ) of the tangent bundle of M , the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator acting on s is defined to be D s ( x ) = ∑ j = 1 n e j ( x ) Γ ~ e j ( x ) s ( x ) , {\\displaystyle Ds(x)=\\sum _{j=1}^{n}e_{j}(x){\\tilde {\\Gamma }}_{e_{j}(x)}s(x),} where Γ ~ {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {\\Gamma }}} is the spin connection , the lifting to S of the Levi-Civita connection on M . When M is n -euclidean space we return to the euclidean Dirac operator . From an Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator D we have the Lichnerowicz formula D 2 = Γ ∗ Γ + τ 4 , {\\displaystyle D^{2}=\\Gamma ^{*}\\Gamma +{\\tfrac {\\tau }{4}},} where τ is the scalar curvature on the manifold , and Γ ∗ is the adjoint of Γ. The operator D 2 is known as the spinorial Laplacian. If M is compact and τ ≥ 0 and τ > 0 somewhere then there are no non-trivial harmonic spinors on the manifold. This is Lichnerowicz' theorem. It is readily seen that Lichnerowicz' theorem is a generalization of Liouville's theorem from one variable complex analysis. This allows us to note that over the space of smooth spinor sections the operator D is invertible such a manifold. In the cases where the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator is invertible on the space of smooth spinor sections with compact support one may introduce C ( x , y ) := D − 1 ∗ δ y , x ≠ y ∈ M , {\\displaystyle C(x,y):=D^{-1}*\\delta _{y},\\qquad x\\neq y\\in M,} where δ y is the Dirac delta function evaluated at y . This gives rise to a Cauchy kernel , which is the fundamental solution to this Dirac operator. From this one may obtain a Cauchy integral formula for harmonic spinors . With this kernel much of what is described in the first section of this entry carries through for invertible Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operators. Using Stokes' theorem , or otherwise, one can further determine that under a conformal change of metric the Dirac operators associated to each metric are proportional to each other, and consequently so are their inverses, if they exist. All of this provides potential links to Atiyah–Singer index theory and other aspects of geometric analysis involving Dirac type operators. ## Hyperbolic Dirac type operators In Clifford analysis one also considers differential operators on upper half space, the disc, or hyperbola with respect to the hyperbolic, or Poincaré metric . For upper half space one splits the Clifford algebra , Cl n into Cl n −1 + Cl n −1 e n . So for a in Cl n one may express a as b + ce n with a , b in Cl n −1 . One then has projection operators P and Q defined as follows P ( a ) = b and Q ( a ) = c . The Hodge–Dirac operator acting on a function f with respect to the hyperbolic metric in upper half space is now defined to be M f = D f + n − 2 x n Q ( f ) {\\displaystyle Mf=Df+{\\frac {n-2}{x_{n}}}Q(f)} . In this case M 2 f = − △ n P ( f ) + n − 2 x n ∂ P ( f ) ∂ x n − ( △ n Q ( f ) − n − 2 x n ∂ Q ( f ) ∂ x n + n − 2 x n 2 Q ( f ) ) e n {\\displaystyle M^{2}f=-\\triangle _{n}P(f)+{\\frac {n-2}{x_{n}}}{\\frac {\\partial P(f)}{\\partial x_{n}}}-\\left(\\triangle _{n}Q(f)-{\\frac {n-2}{x_{n}}}{\\frac {\\partial Q(f)}{\\partial x_{n}}}+{\\frac {n-2}{x_{n}^{2}}}Q(f)\\right)e_{n}} . The operator △ n − n − 2 x n ∂ ∂ x n {\\displaystyle \\triangle _{n}-{\\frac {n-2}{x_{n}}}{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial x_{n}}}} is the Laplacian with respect to the Poincaré metric while the other operator is an example of a Weinstein operator. The hyperbolic Laplacian is invariant under actions of the conformal group, while the hyperbolic Dirac operator is covariant under such actions. ## Rarita–Schwinger/Stein–Weiss operators Rarita–Schwinger operators , also known as Stein–Weiss operators, arise in representation theory for the Spin and Pin groups . The operator R k is a conformally covariant first order differential operator. Here k = 0, 1, 2, .... When k = 0, the Rarita–Schwinger operator is just the Dirac operator. In representation theory for the orthogonal group , O( n ) it is common to consider functions taking values in spaces of homogeneous harmonic polynomials . When one refines this representation theory to the double covering Pin( n ) of O( n ) one replaces spaces of homogeneous harmonic polynomials by spaces of k homogeneous polynomial solutions to the Dirac equation, otherwise known as k monogenic polynomials. One considers a function f ( x , u ) where x in U , a domain in R n , and u varies over R n . Further f ( x , u ) is a k -monogenic polynomial in u . Now apply the Dirac operator D x in x to f ( x , u ). Now as the Clifford algebra is not commutative D x f ( x , u ) then this function is no longer k monogenic but is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial in u . Now for each harmonic polynomial h k homogeneous of degree k there is an Almansi–Fischer decomposition h k ( x ) = p k ( x ) + x p k − 1 ( x ) {\\displaystyle h_{k}(x)=p_{k}(x)+xp_{k-1}(x)} where p k and p k −1 are respectively k and k −1 monogenic polynomials . Let P be the projection of h k to p k then the Rarita–Schwinger operator is defined to be PD k , and it is denoted by R k . Using Euler's Lemma one may determine that D u u p k − 1 ( u ) = ( − n − 2 k + 2 ) p k − 1 . {\\displaystyle D_{u}up_{k-1}(u)=(-n-2k+2)p_{k-1}.} So R k = ( I + 1 n + 2 k − 2 u D u ) D x . {\\displaystyle R_{k}=\\left(I+{\\frac {1}{n+2k-2}}uD_{u}\\right)D_{x}.} ## Conferences and Journals There is a vibrant and interdisciplinary community around Clifford and Geometric Algebras with a wide range of applications.

There were no boundary changes taking effect at this election. ## Election result The Conservatives lost control to Labour, who gained 16 seats. Seat gains/losses are in relation to the previous whole council election in 2007. During the intervening time, four seats changes hands in by-elections; the Conservatives gained four seats, 2 losses each from Labour and Independents. ## Ward results Successful candidates are in bold ; defending incumbents are indicated by \"*\". Percentages are of the total number of votes cast (In multiple member wards, each voter may vote once for each vacancy, i.e., in a three-member ward each voter has three votes). * Summary of result",

    "content": "This is a list of municipalities in Finland having standing links to local communities in other countries known as \" town twinning \" (usually in Europe) or \"sister cities\" (usually in the rest of the world). In Finnish the terms ystävyyskaupungit, ystävyyskunnat are used. Due to Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 , many Finnish municipalities have severed ties with their Russian twin towns. The oldest town twinnings between Finnish and now Russian town are from 1950s . ## A Ähtäri * Audru (Pärnu), Estonia * Dujiangyan, China * Lycksele, Sweden Asikkala is a member of the Douzelage , a town twinning association of towns across the European Union .
